90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- Although the PDF I used for collation is exactly
    the same edition as the edition of the digital text, there are very
    little differences between them. A few titles in the PDF do not appear
    in the text (I showed their places by blank headers) and the text has
    also a few extra titles. I also see very few differences inside the two
    texts.   2- The page numbers at the top of the pages are interred into
    the text. I just untagged them. They must be removed. 3- No 806 in page
    285 is missing and Numbers 940-194 in page 331-2 appear in reverse
    order. 4- All editions of this book is tagged at Sarahâ€™s request.
