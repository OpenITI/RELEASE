90#VERS#COMMENT##: The structure of the book is very arbitrary. The
    author categorizes the names of the people who have quoted the words of
    the prophet in alphabetical order; but after naming someone from a
    specific tribe, he suddenly digresses to name other persons from that
    tribe and then returns to the alphabetical order. I categorized these
    digressions as sub-headers (mostly fifth-level header) and showed the
    return to the alphabetical order by a blank header tag (so that they are
    distinguishable). Moreover, the author names irrelevant names inside a
    category that is supposed to belong to one specific name (for example,
    the author mentions names like “أنسة”, “وإبراهيم”, … under the category
    entitled “من روى عن النبي اسمه: أوس” (in page 75-76)) . I also separated
    these names by a blank header so that they are distinguishable from the
    main category. Besides, sometimes the author names someone out of
    alphabetical order to add some explanation about him. I tagged such
    names with an asterisk (i.e. ### $ *). The last part of the text
    categorized some people according to brotherhood. I tagged these names
    with an asterisk too (see my note on “السفر الثالث” about this kind of
    names).
