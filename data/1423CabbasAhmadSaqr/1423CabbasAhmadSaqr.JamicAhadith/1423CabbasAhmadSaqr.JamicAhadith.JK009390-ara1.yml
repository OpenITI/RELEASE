90#VERS#COMMENT##: JK009390 contains multiple texts:  1. vols. 1-9: a
    composite text based al-Suyūṭī's al-Jāmiʿ al-ṣaghīr  (+ additions) and
    al-jāmiʿ al-kabīr 2. vols. 10-11: al-Munāwī's al-Sharḥ al-Azhar (a
    continuation of al-Suyūṭī's al-Jāmiʿ al-Kabīr) 3. vol. 12: aḥādīth
    mawḍūʿa (fabricated ḥadīth) extracted from  al-Suyūṭī's al-Jāmiʿ al-
    ṣaghīr (+ additions) and al-jāmiʿ al-kabīr 4. vols. 13-21: masānīd
    (ḥadīths with a full isnād going back to the first authority) and
    marāsīl (ḥadīths not traceable to the first generation after the
    Prophet) extracted from al-Suyūṭī's al-Jāmiʿ al-ṣaghīr  (+ additions)
    and al-jāmiʿ al-kabīr PV converted the native tagging into OpenITI tags.
    The tags included `| 40 WORDS 40` or `$ 40 WORDS 40 $`,  in which WORDS
    is usually a name, that is repeated after the second `40` (sometimes the
    first letter or two of the WORDS was before the first `40` and the WORDS
    then continued after the second `40`: e.g. `A\n# | 40 Anas 40 nas`. PV
    removed these tags and the WORDS between them. NB: the file still
    contains a large number of native tags:
    * `# | 30`: start of the matn of a ḥadīth?
    * `# $ 30`: start of an alternative version of a ḥadīth?? Consider
    splitting the text file into separate documents?
