90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- There are three links in the VERS#LINKS. I used
    the first one for collation. It is exactly the Shamela0010283 version
    that I have worked on. But this link leads you to a payment-based
    website and you must have an account to see the contents. So I provided
    the second link which seems to be an older version of the first one. Its
    table of contents is exactly the same. The only difference is that in
    some volumes, page numbers are a slightly different. The problem with
    this second link is that it just includes the first 18 volume; so you
    can’t use it for the next 15 volumes. That’s why I provided the third
    link which is a totally different edition, but still it is partly usable
    for arranging the table of contents. 2- The
    0733Nuwayri.NihayaArab.Sham30K0010283-ara1 version had a lot of
    annotations, but I didn’t use this version, since many of the tags are
    arbitrary. Moreover, this version includes a lot of redundant headers
    and characters. The footnotes are also entered into the text and the
    pages don’t have any paragraphs. All of these make this version unusable
    for annotating. 3- Edit pro supports headers up to the fifth level (i.e:
    ### ||||| which is in blue and after that the colors don’t change
    anymore) and my categorization is correct up to this level. But
    sometimes the text needs headers up to eighth level. Although the Edit
    pro does not support this, I tried to keep up categorizing after fifth
    level header. Nevertheless, there are definitely some mistakes in my
    categorization after fifth level. Accurate categorization after fifth
    level needs thorough reading of the whole text (and, believe me,
    sometimes it is not possible even after close reading! The book’s table
    of contents is by no means accurate in some volumes). 4- The quality of
    the Editpro text is very high. The only difference that I could find was
    2 missing pages (pages 43-45 in Vol 2) and one missing paragraph (first
    paragraph in PageV18P098).
