90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The original digital text included a commentary on
    the text by Muhammad Abduh, rendered entirely in footnotes. I have
    deleted these footnotes and formatted the text so that it now only
    conserves Sharif Radi's text and not Muhammad Abduh's sharh. I will
    submit the original text as a new text as
    1323MuhammadCabduh.SharhNahjBalagha. Masoumeh has added new milestones
    to the text.  I have changed the URI-ID for this version of the text to
    Shia20200618 (the number being the date). The text is generally of good
    quality. The digital text highlighted more sections than the pdf edition
    by numbering extra subsections. I have omitted these extra subsections,
    and deleted the numbers. Subsections of volume 4 may need to be revised
    at a later point, as now every saying (sometimes just a few words) has
    its own subsection. If these are not made headers, however, the whole
    volume would simply be one section, so I thought it would be better to
    at least keep this division.
