90#VERS#COMMENT##: The PDF that I found is exactly the same edition that
    is used in the Editpro text. So, the METADATA can be completed according
    to the book information. 2- All page numbers in the text must be added
    by one. 3- I tagged the names as ### $ when just one name appears at the
    beginning of a sentence in complete form, and I tried to tag all the
    names that could be tagged structurally; however, there are a lot of
    other names inside the sentences that could not be tagged structurally.
    4- Some titles are written separately and bold in the book, but they
    don’t seem to me to be major categories really. I tagged them with an
    asterisk (i.e. ### || *). 6- The categorization of the book does not
    seem to be thorough. Some names, for example, don’t seem to belong to
    their category, but they seem to belong to the former category. So, the
    text probably needs a few invented titles to have a perfect
    categorization. 7- A missing paragraph in page 32.
