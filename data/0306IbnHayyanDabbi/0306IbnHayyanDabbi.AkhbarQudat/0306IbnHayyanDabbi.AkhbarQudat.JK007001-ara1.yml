90#VERS#COMMENT##: The book consists of 3 volumes and 4 sections (which
    do not match). The sections are actually useless and do not have any
    role in the categorization of the text; so I did not tag the beginning
    of the sections (nevertheless, there is an editorial part at the
    beginning of each section; so, they can be found easily). 2- A few
    titles in the margin of the book are not interred into the text. I
    tagged them as blank headers. 3- Some editorial sections are the note of
    the scribe. 4- I kept up categorization until sixth-level header. 4- In
    PageV01P310-311, the names must appear in vertical order, but the typist
    has typed them in horizontal order. This part is editorial; so it is
    probably not important at all. 5- Three missing lines at the end of
    PageV02P428.
