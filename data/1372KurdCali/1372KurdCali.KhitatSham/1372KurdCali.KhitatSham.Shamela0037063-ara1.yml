90#VERS#COMMENT##: The whole volume 5, PageV03P129-136, No. 193 (in PageV06P106), and No. 559 (in page PageV06P151) are missing. 2. The tag ### $ is used for the place entries like the names of schools, mosques... (A few of such entries are inside the lines, or are just descriptions of places without any name. To maintain the consistency of the numbers, I tagged them as well). 3. The numbers of entries are checked by Peterâ€™s script.
