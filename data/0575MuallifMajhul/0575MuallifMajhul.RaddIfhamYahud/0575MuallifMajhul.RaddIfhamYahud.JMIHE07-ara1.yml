90#VERS#COMMENT##: Transcription of 7 fragments of a codex in Hebrew
    letters from the Geniza containing sections belonging to a refutation of
    Samaw'al al-Maghribī (d. 570/1175)'s Ifḥām al-Yahūd  by an unidentified
    Rabbanite Jew.  The text was extracted from an xml version of Jewish-
    Muslim Intellectual History Entangled. Textual Materials from the
    Firkovitch Collection, Saint Petersburg, edited by Camilla Adang, Bruno
    Chiesa, Omar Hamdan, Wilferd Madelung, Sabine Schmidtke and Jan Thiele,
    Open Book Publishers 2020, 373-404 (see pp. 47-52 for an introduction to
    the edition). The pagination of the print version was not represented in
    the xml file; the pagination of the manuscripts  is used instead:
    * PageV0a (ا) refers to St Petersburg, National Library of Russia,
    ms. YA I 1217, fol. 1. (containing only (part of) the ḥamdallah; not
    included in the edition because it is not certain it belongs to the Radd
    Ifḥām al-Yahūd)
    * PageV0b (ب) refers to St Petersburg, National Library of Russia,
    ms. YA I 3020.
    * PageV0j (ج) refers to National Library of Russia, ms. YA II 470,
    fol. 1.
