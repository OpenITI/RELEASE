90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: SP Loynes
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The base and collated texts are both based upon the
    1st edition, although the former refers to a 1st edition published in
    1995, while I used an edition from 2004. The editions appear to be the
    same. The text conforms very closely to the printed edition. The scribe
    has added titles detailing the ayas under discussion, and I have kept
    these as sub-section headings. Unfortunately, the quranic quotations are
    no longer differentiated from the rest of the text by any markers.
