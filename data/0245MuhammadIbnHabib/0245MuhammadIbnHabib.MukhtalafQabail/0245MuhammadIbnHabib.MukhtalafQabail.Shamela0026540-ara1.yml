90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The link in the VERS#LINKS leads you to a payment-
    based website and you probably don’t have access to it. I checked the
    text. The quality of reproduction is high (although I saw a few typos,
    especially in names). 2- The main theme of the text is to categorize the
    names that are similar in shape (like “خلیف” and “حلیف” or “عصبة” and
    “عصية”). I tagged all names as second-level header since most of them
    are not just the name of one person but they refer to people from
    different tribes who have that name; and sometimes no name is mentioned
    at all, but there are just some explanations about the name. All the
    names need to be tagged separately, but I can’t do this because they are
    inside the lines and are not part of the structure of the text; so, they
    could not be tagged structurally. 3-It would be better if this text is
    reviewed by a specialist in Rijal literature. 4- You can find a
    manuscript of the book here:
