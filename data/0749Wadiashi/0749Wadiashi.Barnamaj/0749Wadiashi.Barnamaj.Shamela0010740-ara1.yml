90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: LMN
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The author's opening remarks indicate that the two
    parts form part of the original structure of the work; "[al-juzʾ al-
    awwal min barnāmaj Wādī Āshī]" has been added by the annotator in square
    brackets to make that clearer;  the underlying print edition is not
    consistent with regard to paragraphs;  the numbers preceding the
    individuals listed in the text were shifted by the annotator; this way,
    each dictionary item includes terms such as muḥaddith, shaykh, zāhid
    (etc.), a number of which almost always precedes the name of the
    individual properly speaking.
