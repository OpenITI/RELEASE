90#VERS#COMMENT##: The METADATA section is not in its normal shape.
    2-The edition I used for annotation is a reprint of Editpro edition
    published by a different publisher; but in the appendixes attached to
    the end of the third volume, the editor has added some newly-founded
    parts to the text that do not exist in Editpro text. 3- There are a lot
    of names in the third volume, but they are not part of the structure of
    the book since they don’t have any number or any other sign which
    separate them. So, they could not be tagged (structurally). 4- I kept up
    categorization until six-level header (Although Editpro does not support
    this and the colors don’t change anymore after fifth-level header). 5-In
    Vol 3, we know that Yazid passed away in 64 AH. So, the rest of the
    years could not be categorized under his reign.
