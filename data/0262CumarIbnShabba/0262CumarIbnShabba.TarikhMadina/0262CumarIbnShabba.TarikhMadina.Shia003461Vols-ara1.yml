90#VERS#COMMENT##: As the editor of the text states at the beginning of
    the Table of Contents (page 1331), there are two types of headers in the
    book. The first type is the ones that appear in the original manuscript,
    and the second type is the ones that the editor had to add them because
    the first type of headers are too general and are mostly irrelevant to
    their contents. So, the editor has added a kind of conceptual headers to
    show the beginning of a new subject. I have tagged all the first type
    headers (the ones that appear in the original manuscript) as second-
    level headers and all the second type headers (the ones that have been
    added by the editor) as third-level headers (which are just headers
    without any text, since annotators are not allowed to add anything to
    the text). Tagging these third-level headers was extremely difficult.
    Many of the pages have more than one header and since the contents of
    the paragraphs are sometimes very similar, you cannot say for sure to
    which paragraph the conceptual header of the editor exactly belongs. The
    situations even worsen when you realize that the page numbers in the
    table of contents is not very accurate and sometimes the subject begins
    one page before or after the page mentioned in the table of contents or,
    even worse, when you find other mistakes in the table of contents (like
    “حذیفه” instead of “خزیمه” which is mentioned in the table of contents
    for page 1000). Anyway, although I had to read most of the text to
    decide about annotating third-level headers, I didn’t have enough time
    to read the text in detail; if anybody does this, he/she might decide to
    change the positions of some third-level headers. Besides, I tried to
    put the titles at the beginning of the respective paragraphs;
    nevertheless, this was not sometimes possible as some paragraphs have
    two titles and need to be broken into two parts.
