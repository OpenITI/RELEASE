Please, copy-paste questions from `text_questionnaire.md` into this file and answer the questions.
If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

I choose the first of the two Shamela versions, because I found a fitting pdf for it and the structure seems quite solid. It's similar to the JK version, but the second shamela text seems to be very different in comparison (much longer - completly different structure)

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

See urls_additional

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

No typos found.

## 4. Add any comments on the text

The text is a collection of bibliographical entries. They are all just marked by numbers. It would be possible to bring the names into the headlines as well in a reasonable time, but I didn't do it, because I didn't knew if it's worth the effort.
