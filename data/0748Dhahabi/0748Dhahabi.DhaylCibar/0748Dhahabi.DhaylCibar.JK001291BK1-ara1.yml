90#VERS#COMMENT##: This text was published with al-Ḥusaynī's dhayl; PV
    split the two texts (see also
    0765AbuMahasinHusayni.DhaylCibar.JK001291BK2-ara1)
    - 1st level is listed in the table of contents 2nd level isn't.
    - all the headlines were marked already -> JK randomly checked if
    everything is complete  and didn't find any missing or wrongly marked
    headline
    - PV tagged a number of missing year sections and formatted the
    manuscript page numbers.
