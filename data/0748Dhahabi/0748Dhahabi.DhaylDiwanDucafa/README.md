## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

Just Shamela version available.

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

-> See urls additional
I couldn't see wether it was exactly the same version, because there were no page numbers in the markdown text + no introduction and final remarks. Anyways the structure of the text was very clear so the version was working very well.  

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

I didn't recognized any typos

## 4. Add any comments on the text

The text is basically a list of names in alphabetical order. Just some minor changes had to be made.
