90#VERS#COMMENT##: The edition is based on an older edition published in
    India in 1306AH, which in turn was based on a manuscript copy of the
    author's autograph.  The editor collated it with another edition,
    published in  Medina (al-Maṭbaʿa al-Salafiyya), and with al-Albānī's
    Mukhtaṣar al-ʿUluww (ed. al-Maktab al-Islāmī). (see editor's
    introduction, p. 5) The editor notes in his introduction (p. 5) that he
    added  a number of explanatory titles "at the beginning of the book;  at
    least one of those (p. 102) is marked in the text with a footnote
    stating it was added by the editor. In the introduction (p. 5), the
    editor also notes that he  tagged al-Dhahabī's comments with a small
    symbol (a circle), and his judgment about aḥādīth with another symbol (a
    black dot);  they are marked in the digitized text with two forward
    slashes.
