Please, copy-paste questions from `text_questionnaire.md` into this file and answer the questions.
If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

I chose the JK version. There didn't seemed to be hugh differences in the quality of the three version. The shia and shamela version comprise 4 volumes - the JK version 8 volumes. Still the number of bibliographical entries is the same in the three version. 

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

pdf in urls (last one)

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

57554 -> corrected
38723 -> corrected
39503 -> corrected
39942 -> corrected
-> all concern the numbering there were a lot more that I regognized (~100) that I did not correct.

## 4. Add any comments on the text

- headlines seem quite complete, but it was hard to check if they are all marked (because of hugh number of pages and no detailed table of contents).
- The proper names are sufficantly marked. There are less than 20 of ~12000 bibliographical entries missing.
