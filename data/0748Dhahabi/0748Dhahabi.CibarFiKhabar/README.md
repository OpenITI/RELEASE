1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

PDF was the exact match. But there are numbers in the PDF which don't occur in the text. The other text (JK) didn't match the PDF.

2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

s. above, used links in urls.txt

3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

no

4. Add any comments on the text

The JK-version has 5 volumes. The Shamela (which I used) as well as the only available PDF have 4.
