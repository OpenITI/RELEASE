Please, copy-paste questions from `text_questionnaire.md` into this file and answer the questions.
If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

I chose the - shia - text. 
The PDF I found fits for this text and also for the the JK text but not for Shamela.
I chose shia over JK because there are more pages included (the first 180 are missing in JK)
Pre-structuring seems similar camparing the two texts.

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

-> See urls additional
pagination is the same

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

Type your response here.

## 4. Add any comments on the text

Text was a little bit difficult to handle.
I finally have the approxmatly 7000 bibligraphic entries marked (except for about 100 missing for which I was not able to formulate a fitting regex). 
Apart from that I got the major headlines tagged (the ones in the table of contents) and also some lower levels (which are often a bit hard to make out - and sometimes it's not quite obvious what is a more respectivly less important headline or number). Altough there could be more levels added in some cases - though I didn't knew how important this is.

-> might be good to have another look on the text
