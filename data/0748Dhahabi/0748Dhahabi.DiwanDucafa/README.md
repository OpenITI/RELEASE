If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

Only Shamela text was available.

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

-> See urls_additional
The edition is very close to the text. In the text markdown text there are no pagenumbers given.

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

sometimes the [7rakaat] are missing for instance page 307 & 308: In the pdf there is a distinction made between -> عمير and عُمَيْر which is abscent in the markdown text.
 
## 4. Add any comments on the text

Text was quite time consuming to tag. Even if all entries were marked, there were quite some irregularities: mostly if there was "<span/>" within the headline, sometimes because of extra pagination signs like [249ص] or if there was a (1) after the number of the bibliographical entry.

Basiclly the whole text is marked as headline. The structure is based on names in alphabatical order which are numbered. There would always be the name and one or two sentences afterwards, which are also left in the headline for time reasons.
