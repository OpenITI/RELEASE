90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- In Vol 1, the categorization is based on the names
    of the kings. So, these titles must be added in front of the blank
    titles that I have added: PageV01P167: “فيروز”; PageV01P215: “أبرويز”.
    2- From Vol 3 onwards, the text has a dual categorization. The first
    categorization is based on the names of the caliphs and the second
    categorization is chronological. So, after the name of a caliph, a year
    must be mentioned. But the problem is that this is missing. I added a
    blank fourth-level header with an asterisk (i.e. # |||| *) in such
    places. A title like “تتمة حوادث سنة ...” must be added in front of my
    added headers. 3- Some titles that appear in the PDF are missing in the
    text. I put blank headers in their places (without any asterisk, so that
    they are distinguishable from those that must be added to the text).
    4-These titles must be added in Vol 7: PageV07P017: “تتمة العصر
    العباسي”; PageV07P395: “تتمة العصر العباسي”; “تتمة خلافة القادر بالله”;
    “تتمة حوادث سنة تسع وثمانين وثلاثمائة”. 5- The book’s table of contents
    is not accurate in categorization. I tried to present a correct
    categorization as far as the process of events could be inferred from
    the titles; however, a more accurate categorization might be possible if
    someone reads the text thoroughly. For example, in one case (the story
    of “صفين” in PageV01P511), I couldn’t understand in which point this
    story ends. 6- All editorial sections except the first one are the notes
    of the scribe. 7- The Quality of the text is very high. I just saw one
    mistake in the title in PageV01P329.
