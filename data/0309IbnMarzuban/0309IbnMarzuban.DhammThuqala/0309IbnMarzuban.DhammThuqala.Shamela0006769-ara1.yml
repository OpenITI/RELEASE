90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: There are two links in VERS#LINKS. The first one (a
    link to a payment-based website) is exactly the edition which is used in
    in Editpro versions. I checked this text. Although it is an HTML file (I
    couldnâ€™t find the PDF of this edition), it shows that there is no title
    in this very short text (and nothing else that need to be tagged). I
    also collated the text with the second link in the VERS#LINKS which is a
    PDF of a different edition of the text. This edition has no title
    either. So, as far as structural annotating is concerned, there is
    nothing in this text that needs to be tagged. 2- It is a little difficult to separate the PARATEXT from the  text since the text begins with a first-person narratoin.
