90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The Editpro versions (Shamela and JK) were not found.
    The only thing I found was a different edition (edited by “السناري”) and
    a manuscript of the text (both accessible through VERS#LINKS). They both
    show that there is no title in this very short text. So, they suffice
    for structural annotation; although for analytical annotation or a more
    detailed analysis of the text, a better edition (one of the Shamela or
    JK versions, which are not accessible on the internet) might be needed.
    The Shamela version I’ve worked on seems to have a better quality than
    the “السناري” edition.
