90#VERS#COMMENT##: Books about Nasab of people and tribes are very
    difficult for tagging. I tagged this text twice to find the correct
    structure. Some explanations: 1- Pages 100-104, 199, 319, and 477 are
    “سماع” for the book. I tagged them as editorial since they are not
    written by the original author. 2- Some titles are repeated several
    times redundantly. I untagged them but showed them with two asterisks
    (i.e. # **) so that they are distinguishable. 3- The tagged names under
    each title (“ومن ولد ...”) must be his children, but sometimes the
    author names some other persons that are related to the children. I
    tagged these persons with an asterisk (i.e. ### $ *) so that they are
    distinguishable from the children. 4- I used the tag for a group of
    names (i.e. ### $$$$) when the author names more than one child in a
    line. 5- I kept up categorization until six-level header (Although
    Editpro does not support this and the colors don’t change anymore after
    fifth-level header). 6- Missing parts: A missing title in page 236; a
    missing name in page 259; a missing line in page 407. 7- These titles
    (taken from the descriptive table of contents at the end of the book)
    must be added to their respective pages so that the book gains a clear
    structure (I just put a blank header instead of them but I didn’t add
    them because I’m not allowed to add anything to the text; However, they
    must be added anyway): 70: “عباد بن عبد الله بن الزبير”; 80: “ثابت بن
    عبد الله”; 97: “ومن ولد ثابت”; 115: “مصعب بن ثابت بن عبد الله بن
    الزبير”; 203 : “ومن ولد عبد الله بن مصعب”; 236: “ولد المنذر بن الزبير”;
    249: “ومن ولد المنذر بن الزبير”; 258: “ومن ولد المنذر بن الزبير”; 297:
    “ومن ولد الزبير بن هشام بن عروة”; 299: “هشام بن عروة” (?). 8- The
    structure of the book can still become more accurate; because some parts
    could not be tagged (structurally). For example, inside a biographical
    tag, the author digresses to explain about someone related to him (See
    page 156 ff for example, which is mostly about “طلحة”, the grandfather
    of “أبوبكر” until page 163 in which the author returns to “أبوبكر”
    again). I can’t tag such names, because they are not part of the
    structure of the text. Many of the children of the main persons cannot
    be tagged too, since they are inside the text and are not part of the
    structure of the text. 9- A problem in METADATA: “مطبعة المدني” is the
    printing company. The publisher is “مكتبة دار العروبة”.
