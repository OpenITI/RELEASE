90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The link in VERS#LINKS leads you to a payment-
    based website and you must have an account to see the contents (if you
    can’t access this link, a different edition of the book can be found
    here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikisource/ar/0/08/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85
    %D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83_%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8
    3.pdf; Although, this is another edition. It might be useful). 2- The
    text has been annotated. Nevertheless, there is a descriptive Table of
    contents at the end of the book whose titles could be added to the text
    to make the structure of the book much more accurate. However, this is
    just a suggestion and I didn’t do it, since the text lacks these
    descriptive titles and I’m not allowed to add anything to the text (they
    must be added by anyone who reads the text closely). 3- You can also
    find a manuscript of the book here:
