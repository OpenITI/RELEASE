90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: I tagged the 10 names in the first part of the text as titles, since each of them includes a lot of subsections. But after the beginning of alphabetical order of the names, I tagged them as biographical. Some of the names at this section also include subsections. Since we do not have a tag to categorize the subsections of biographical entries, I tagged such sections as paragraphs but with three asterisks (# ***) so that they are distinguishable. 2- From pages 1262 and 1290 onwards, the author talks about some people whose names are not known. Since it is not possible to use the biographical tag for such cases (since there is no specific name), I tagged the beginning of each section as paragraph with two asterisks (# **) so that the section for each person is easily distinguishable. 3- The first 4 pages of the PDF are missing.
