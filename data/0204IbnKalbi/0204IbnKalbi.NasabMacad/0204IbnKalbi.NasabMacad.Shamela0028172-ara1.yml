90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- One typo could be found in almost all pages. 2-
    Occasional missing lines (like: two missing lines in Page 58, a missing
    line in page 93, and two lines in page 225). 3- I tagged the names as
    ### $ when just one name appears at the beginning of a sentence in
    complete form and I tried to tag all the names that could be tagged
    structurally (to avoid reworking); however, there are a lot of other
    names inside the sentences that could not be tagged structurally. 4-
    There is a note of the scribe at the end of the book. I tagged it as
    editorial.
