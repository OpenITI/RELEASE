90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The link in VERS#LINKS leads you to a payment-
    based website and you must have an account to see the PDF. This PDF that
    I have used for collation is a reprint of the SHAMELA edition published
    by another publisher (I couldn’t find any other accessible PDF on the
    internet). 2- The book entitled “الشامل في الصناعة الطبية” has 30
    volumes. The SHAMELA text, as it is written in the METADATA, is “كتاب
    الهمزة” which is in fact the first two volumes of these 30 volumes. I do
    not consider this an INCOMPLETE_VERSION; because the title specifies
    that this text is just “كتاب الهمزة”, and not the whole book. However,
    maybe I must warn that this text does not include the remaining 28
    volumes. 3- Pages PageV02P508-532 are missing.
