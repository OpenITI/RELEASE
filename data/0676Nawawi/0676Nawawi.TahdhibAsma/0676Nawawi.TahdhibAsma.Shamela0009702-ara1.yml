90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: I tagged the first three names as headers (not
    biography) because they include a lot of subsections. A few of the
    biographical tags also include subsections. I showed such subsections as
    paragraphs but with two asterisks (i.e. # **) so that they are
    distinguishable. 2- To present the correct leveling for headers, a few
    titles need to be added. The title in PageV01P010 (“[القسم الأول: في
    الأسماء]”) must be separated into two titles: first-level = “كتاب
    الأسماء”, and second-level = “القسم الأول من كتاب الأسماء: فى الرجال”.
    In PageV01P021 two titles must be added: Third-level = “النوع الأول: فى
    الأسماء الصريحة”, and fourth-level = “محمدون”. 3- The second part of the
    book is a dictionary and explains about some words in alphabetical
    order. I used the complete tag (i.e. ### $DIC_LEX$ for lexical entries
    and ### $DIC_TOP$ for toponyms) in this part. As discussed in the
    meeting, I did not use simplified tag (i.e. ### $) for such items
    because the book also includes lots of names and the simplified tag is
    the same as biographical tag and these two needed to be distinguishable
    in the text. There was no automatic tag for this second part of the book
    and all the tags in this part are inserted manually. 4- Numbers 930-977
    are the names of tribes or groups of people. I also tagged them as
    lexical entries (i.e. ### $DIC_LEX$) so that they are distinguishable.
    However, I’m not sure about this, because we do not have a specific tag
    for the names of tribes. So, maybe it should be changed. 5- In page
    1/221 of the PDF, the numbers jump from 213 to 215 and in page 240 of
    the PDF, number 241 is repeated. But the digital version has corrected
    this mistake. This is why from pages 215-240, the numbers in the digital
    version are one less than those in the PDF and after that the numbers
    are the same again. So, this is a problem in the PDF and the digital
    version is correct. Besides, In the PDF, The numbers resume at the
    beginning of each Juz’, but in the digital version they continue from
    the previous Juz’. The digital version is again better than the PDF. 6-
    These numbers that appear among the names are not names and do not need
    to be tagged: 1094-1139;1261-1272; 1030-1093; 1233-1260. I just showed
    their places with one asterisk (i.e. # *).
