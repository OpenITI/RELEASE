90#VERS#COMMENT##: Edition is based on three manuscripts, from ninth, tenth, and thirteenth (hijri) centuries. A few other editions available on-line are simply extracted from later sharhs, so it seems that this is a relatively good edition. I could however not locate it on worldcat. Two sections have been omitted from the digital text: the first paragraph after the basmallah in which the author (Nawawi) is identified, and the text's conclusion (pdf pp. 118-120). Less problematic but also divergent: first title in the edition is [khutbat al-kitaab], but in digital text this has been changed; in the edition every hadith is introduced by a heading and a phrase in square brackets to denote the topic, but this information in square brackets is not present in the digital text. Pagination is correct, but paragraphs are inconsistent.
