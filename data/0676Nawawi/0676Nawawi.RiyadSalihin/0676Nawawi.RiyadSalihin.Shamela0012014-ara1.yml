90#VERS#COMMENT##: This edition seemed best, pagination was mostly
    correct and useful pre-tagging was in place. Text includes references
    identifying Quran verses, but these are also in the body text in the
    pdf. I have left them in place, but they do give the text a somewhat
    messy look in places. The individual numbering for each hadith had been
    pre-tagged as structural unit. I have left this in place and moved it to
    third level headers. There was an issue with page numbers: in front of
    every bab (level 1 header) the page number on which it appears was
    inserted, which results in redundancy. I have deleted these redundant
    page numbers manually, but may have missed some.  Chapters 49-63 (hadith
    390-570) were not in the right place in the digital text, so I have
    copied them to the right place. Similarly, pages 468 and 469 had been
    switched around, I have fixed that.  Contents of page 387 are missing
    (two hadiths, 1384-5), as is hadith 1749 on p. 485
