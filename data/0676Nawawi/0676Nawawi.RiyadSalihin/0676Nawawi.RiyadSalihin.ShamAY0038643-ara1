### || AUTO 1 - باب الإخلاص وإحضار النية في جميع الأعمال والأقوال
~~والأحوال البارزة والخفية
# Sincerity and Significance of Intentions and all Actions, Apparent and Hidden PageV01P002
~~بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم
# قال الله تعالى ( البينة 5 ) : { وما أمروا إلا ليعبدوا الله مخلصين له
~~الدين حنفاء ويقيموا الصلاة ويؤتوا الزكاة وذلك دين القيمة }
# Allah, the Exalted, says:
# "And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and
~~worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him),
~~and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat) and give Zakat, and that is the
~~right religion.'' (98:5
# وقال تعالى ( الحج 37 ) : { لن ينال الله لحومها ولا دماؤها ولكن يناله
~~التقوى منكم }
# "It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it
~~is piety from you that reaches Him.'' (22:37)
# وقال تعالى ( آل عمران 29 ) : { قل إن تخفوا ما في صدوركم أو تبدوه يعلمه الله }
# "Say (O Muhammad (PBUH) ): Whether you hide what is in your breasts or
~~reveal it, Allah knows it". (3:29)

### ||| AUTO 1 - وعن أمير المؤمنين أبي حفص عمر بن الخطاب بن نفيل بن عبد
~~العزى بن رياح بن عبد
# الله بن قرط بن رزاح بن عدي بن كعب بن لؤي بن غالب القرشي العدوي رضي
~~الله عنه قال سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول : [ إنما الأعمال
~~بالنيات وإنما لكل امرئ ما نوى . فمن كانت هجرته إلى الله ورسوله فهجرته
~~إلى الله ورسوله ومن كانت هجرته لدنيا يصيبها أو امرأة ينكحها فهجرته إلى
~~ما هاجر إليه ] متفق على صحته . رواه إماما المحدثين : أبو عبد الله محمد
~~بن إسماعيل بن إبراهيم بن المغيرة بن بردزبه الجعفي البخاري وأبو الحسين
~~مسلم بن الحجاج بن مسلم القشيري النيسابوري رضي الله عنهما في كتابيهما
~~اللذين هما أصح الكتب المصنفة.
# 1. Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him),
~~reported: Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "The deeds are considered by
~~the intentions, and a person will get the reward according to his
~~intention. So whoever emigrated for Allah and His Messenger, his
~~emigration will be for Allah and His Messenger; and whoever emigrated
~~for worldly benefits or for a woman to marry, his emigration would be
~~for what he emigrated for".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: According to some Ahadith, the reason for this Hadith is
~~that a person sent a proposal of marriage to a woman named Umm Qais,
~~which she turned down saying that he should have to emigrate to Al-
~~Madinah for it. Accordingly, he did it for this specific purpose, and
~~the two were married there. On account of this event, the man came to be
~~known among the Companions as Muhajir Umm Qais.
# On the basis of this Hadith, 'Ulama' are of the unanimous opinion that
~~the real basis of one's actions is Niyyah (intention) and everyone will
~~be requited according to his Niyyah. It is true that Niyyah is founded
~~in one's heart, that is to say, one has first to make up one's mind for
~~what he intends to do and he should not express it verbally. In fact,
~~the latter is a Bid`ah (innovation in religion) because no proof of it
~~is found in Shariah.
# The point which becomes evident from this Hadith is that Ikhlas
~~(sincerity) is a must for every action. In other words, in every
~~righteous deed, one should seek only the Pleasure of Allah; otherwise,
~~it will not be accepted by Allah.

### ||| AUTO 2 - وعن أم المؤمنين أم عبد الله عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت
~~قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ يغزو جيش الكعبة فإذا كانوا ببيداء
~~من الأرض يخسف بأولهم وآخرهم ] قالت قلت : يا رسول الله كيف يخسف بأولهم
~~وآخرهم وفيهم أسواقهم ومن ليس منهم ؟ قال : [ يخسف بأولهم وآخرهم ثم يبعثون
~~على نياتهم ] متفق عليه . هذا لفظ البخاري.
# 2. 1-2- Narrated 'A`ishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "An army will raid the Ka`bah and when
~~it reaches a desert land, all of them will be swallowed up by the
~~earth.'' She asked; "O Messenger of Allah! Why all of them?'' He
~~answered, "All of them will be swallowed by the earth but they will be
~~raised for Judgement according to their intentions.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: Everyone will be rewarded or punished according to his aim
~~and intention. This Hadith also proves that the company of depraved
~~persons is extremely dangerous. Whose army would it be, which has been
~~referred to in the Hadith, and when will it invade Ka`bah, is a matter
~~known to Allah Alone. Such prophecies are a part of the Unseen world.
~~Since they come in the category of the miracles of the Prophet (PBUH),
~~it is necessary to believe in their veracity and occurrence. Believing
~~in such prophesies is also essential because they were revealed by
~~Allah).
PageV01P005
### ||| AUTO 3 - وعن عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت قال النبي صلى الله عليه
~~وسلم : [ لا هجرة بعد الفتح ولكن جهاد ونية وإذا استنفرتم فانفروا ] متفق عليه
# ومعناه : لا هجرة من مكة لأنها صارت دار إسلام.
# 3- A`ishah (May Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet
~~(PBUH) said, "There is no emigration after the conquest (of Makkah) but
~~only Jihad [(striving and fighting in the cause of Allah) will continue]
~~and good intention.* So if you are summoned to fight, go forth.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# *. Intention according to An-Nawawi: It means that goodness which
~~ceased to continue by the cessation of emigration can still be obtained
~~by Jihad and by intending accomplishing good deeds.
# Commentary. When a country or a region is regarded as Dar-ul-Islam
~~(land of Islam), it is not necessary to migrate from it to some other
~~place. It is, however, obligatory to emigrate from such regions which
~~are Dar-ul-Kufr (land of infidels) and where it is difficult to adhere
~~to Islamic injunctions. It is also evident from this Hadith that when it
~~is not necessary to migrate from one Islamic country to another then it
~~is also not permitted by the Shari`ah to leave an Islamic country to
~~settle permanently in Dar-ul-Kufr only for the reason that the latter
~~has plenty of wealth and social welfare. Unfortunately, Muslims today
~~are afflicted with this disease. The transfer of their capital and
~~talent to Dar-ul-Kufr is indeed very disturbing because on one side
~~these two factors are lending support to the economy of Bilad-ul-Kufr
~~(countries of infidels) and on the other, obscenity and indecency that
~~are common in such countries, are becoming increasingly common among the
~~Muslims too.
# Another highly important reason for the prohibition of migration of
~~Muslims to Dar-ul-Kufr is that it goes against the spirit as well as
~~their readiness for Jihad fi sabilillah (striving and fighting in the
~~way of Allah). This spirit and readiness must be kept always alive so
~~that the Muslims may respond at once to the call of Jihad whenever the
~~need for it arises anywhere.

### ||| AUTO 4 - وعن أبي عبد الله جابر بن عبد الله الأنصاري رضي الله
~~عنهما قال : كنا مع النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم في غزاة فقال : [ إن بالمدينة
~~لرجالا ما سرتم مسيرا ولا قطعتم واديا إلا ms001 كانوا معكم حبسهم المرض]
# وفي رواية : إلا شركوكم في الأجر ] رواه مسلم
# ورواه البخاري عن أنس قال : [ رجعنا من غزوة تبوك مع النبي صلى الله عليه
~~وسلم فقال : [ إن أقواما خلفنا بالمدينة ما سلكنا شعبا ولا واديا ألا وهم
~~معنا حبسهم العذر ].
# 4. 4- Jabir bin Abdullah Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with them)
~~reported: We accompanied the Prophet (PBUH) in an expedition when he
~~said, "There are some men in Al-Madinah who are with you wherever you
~~march and whichever valley you cross. They have not joined you in person
~~because of their illness.'' In another version he said: "They share the
~~reward with you.''
# [Muslim].
# It is narrated by Bukhari from Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased
~~with him): We were coming back from the battle of Tabuk with the Prophet
~~(PBUH) when he remarked, "There are people whom we left behind in Al-
~~Madinah who accompanied us in spirit in every pass and valley we
~~crossed. They remained behind for a valid excuse.''
# Commentary: What we learn from this Hadith is that if the intention
~~and spirit of Jihad are present in the heart of a Muslim but physically
~~he is unable to take part in it for valid reasons, he will get the
~~reward of Jihad without even his actual participation in it.
PageV01P007
### ||| AUTO 5 - وعن أبي يزيد معن بن يزيد بن الأخنس رضي الله عنهم وهو
~~وأبوه وجده صحابيون قال : كان أبي يزيد أخرج دنانير يتصدق بها فوضعها عند
~~رجل في المسجد فجئت فأخذتها فأتيته بها فقال : والله ما إياك أردت فخاصمته
~~إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال : [ لك ما نويت يا يزيد ولك ما أخذت
~~يا معن ] رواه البخاري.
# 5- Ma`n bin Yazid bin Akhnas (May Allah be pleased with them) (he, his
~~father and his grandfather, all were Companions) reported: My father set
~~aside some dinars for charity and gave them to a man in the mosque. I
~~went to that man and took back those dinars. He said: "I had not
~~intended you to be given.'' So we went to Messenger of Allah (PBUH), and
~~put forth the matter before him. He said to my father, "Yazid, you have
~~been rewarded for what you intended.'' And he said to me, "Ma`n, you are
~~entitled to what you have taken.''
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary:
# 1- This Hadith leads us to the conclusion that if Sadaqah (charity),
~~goes to a needy son of a Muslim, there is no need to take it back from
~~him for the reason that the father had intended to give it to a
~~deserving person. The former gets the reward for it on account of his
~~Niyyah (intention). This however, will be reckoned as Nafli Sadaqah
~~(voluntary charity) because the obligatory Zakat (Sadaqah) cannot be
~~given to the donor's own dependents.
# 2- It is permissible in Shari`ah to make someone a Wakil (attorney or
~~agent) for Sadaqah.
# 3- It does not amount to disobedience on the part of a son to take his
~~father to a competent authority or scholar to know the legal position on
~~any issue, in the same way, as mutual discussion and debate on matters
~~of Shari`ah does not amount to insolence. (Fath Al-Bari, chapter on
~~Zakat). .

### ||| AUTO 6 - وعن أبي إسحاق سعد بن أبي وقاص مالك بن أهيب بن عبد مناف
~~بن زهرة بن كلاب بن مرة بن كعب بن لؤي القرشي الزهري رضي الله عنه أحد
~~العشرة المشهود لهم بالجنة رضي الله عنهم قال : جاءني رسول الله صلى الله
~~عليه وسلم يعودني عام حجة الوداع من وجع اشتد بي فقلت : يا رسول الله إني
~~قد بلغ بي من الوجع ما ترى وأنا ذو مال ولا يرثني إلا ابنة لي أفأتصدق
~~بثلثي مالي ؟ قال [ لا ] قلت : فالشطر يا رسول الله ؟ فقال [ لا ] قال :
~~فالثلث يا رسول الله ؟ قال : [ الثلث والثلث كثير أو كبير إنك أن تذر ورثتك
~~أغنياء خير من أن تذرهم عالة يتكففون الناس وإنك لن تنفق نفقة تبتغي بها
~~وجه الله إلا أجرت عليها حتى ما تجعل في في امرأتك ] قال فقلت : يا رسول
~~الله أخلف بعد أصحابي ؟ قال : [ إنك لن تخلف فتعمل عملا تبتغي به وجه الله
~~إلا ازددت به درجة ورفعة ولعلك أن تخلف حتى ينتفع بك أقوام ويضر بك آخرون
~~اللهم أمض لأصحابي هجرتهم ولا تردهم على أعقابهم لكن البائس سعد بن خولة ]
~~يرثي له رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أن مات بمكة . متفق عليه .
# 6- Abu Ishaq Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas (May Allah be pleased with him) (one
~~of the ten who had been given the glad tidings of entry into Jannah)
~~narrated: Messenger of Allah (PBUH) visited me in my illness which
~~became severe in the year of Hajjat-ul-Wada` (Farewell Pilgrimage). I
~~said, "O Messenger of Allah, you can see the pain which I am suffering
~~and I am a man of means and there is none to inherit from me except one
~~daughter. Should I give two-thirds of my property in charity?'' He
~~(PBUH) said, "No". I asked him, "Then half?'' He said, "No". Then I
~~asked, "Can I give away one-third". He said, "Give away one-third, and
~~that is still too much. It is better to leave your heirs well-off than
~~to leave them poor, begging people. You will not expend a thing in
~~charity for the sake of Allah, but you will be rewarded for it; even the
~~morsel of food which you feed your wife''. I said, "O Messenger of
~~Allah, would I survive my companions?'' He said, "If you survive others
~~and accomplish a thing for the sake of Allah, you would gain higher
~~ranking and standing. You will survive them ... your survival will be
~~beneficial to people (the Muslim) and harmful to others (the enemies of
~~Islam). You will survive others till the people will derive benefit from
~~you, and others would be harmed by you.'' Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
~~further said, "O Allah, complete for my Companions their emigration and
~~do not cause them to retract.'' Sa`d bin Khaulah was unfortunate.
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) lamented his death as he died in Makkah.
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: In spite of all their love for it, the Companions of the
~~Prophet (PBUH) did not like to die in a city from which they emigrated
~~for the sake of Allah. For this reason Sa`d (May Allah be pleased with
~~him) was afraid of dying in Makkah. The Prophet (PBUH) prayed for the
~~accomplishment of Sa`d's emigration and expressed regret over the
~~misfortune of Sa`d bin Khaulah. The latter died in Makkah.
# Conclusion:
# 1- The Hadith lays down that in the course of a disease which seems to
~~prove fatal, one cannot give more than one-third of the property in
~~charity.
# 2- It is also emphasized that one gets reward even for what he spends
~~on his wife and children.
# 3- One can report to others his ailment or to seek treatment and ask
~~them to supplicate from him.
# 4- In the matter of Sadaqah (charity), which one gives to seek the
~~Pleasure of Allah, his closest relatives. should always have priority
~~and preference over others.

### ||| AUTO 7 - وعن أبي هريرة عبد الرحمن بن صخر رضي الله عنه قال قال
~~رسول الله صلى الله عليه ms002 وسلم : [ إن الله تعالى لا ينظر إلى أجسامكم ولا
~~إلى صوركم ولكن ينظر إلى قلوبكم ] رواه مسلم
# 7- Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) narrated: Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) said, "Allah does not look at your figures, nor at your
~~attire but He looks at your hearts and accomplishments".
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith highlights the importance of sincerity and
~~good intention. It is, therefore, essential that every noble action
~~should be based on these two virtues; and heart should be free from all
~~such things that destroy noble deeds. Hypocrisy, ostentation, greed for
~~wealth, riches and other wordly things fall in the category of such
~~evils. Since the true condition of heart is known to Allah alone, the
~~true position of one's actions will be known on the Day of Resurrection
~~when one will be requited for them by Alah. In this world, one will be
~~treated according to his apparent condition while his insight will be
~~left to Allah.
PageV01P010
### ||| AUTO 8 - وعن أبي موسى عبد الله بن قيس الأشعري رضي الله عنه قال :
~~سئل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم عن الرجل يقاتل شجاعة ويقاتل حمية ويقاتل
~~رياء أي ذلك في سبيل الله ؟ فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ من قاتل
~~لتكون كلمة الله هي العليا فهو في سبيل الله ] متفق عليه.
# 8- Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) was asked about who fights in the battlefield
~~out of valour, or out of zeal, or out of hypocrisy, which of this is
~~considered as fighting in the cause of Allah? He said: "He who fights in
~~order that the Word of Allah remains the supreme, is considered as
~~fighting in the cause of Allah".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: Since one's action will be evaluated in terms of
~~intention, so he alone would be a Mujahid (warrior in the cause of Deen)
~~who fights to glorify the Name of Allah.
PageV01P011
### ||| AUTO 9 - وعن أبي بكرة نفيع بن الحارث الثقفي رضي الله عنه أن
~~النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال :
# [ إذا التقى المسلمان بسيفيهما فالقاتل والمقتول في النار ] قلت : يا
~~رسول الله هذا القاتل فما بال المقتول ؟ قال : [ إنه كان حريصا على قتل
~~صاحبه ] متفق عليه .
# 9- Abu Bakrah Ath-Thaqafi (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:
~~The Prophet (PBUH) said: "When two Muslims are engaged in a combat
~~against each other with their sword's and one is killed, both are doomed
~~to Hell". I said, "O Messenger of Allah! As to the one who kills, it is
~~understandable, but why the slain one?" He (PBUH) replied: "He was eager
~~to kill his opponent".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith leads to the conclusion that one would be
~~punished for such sinful intention for which he has made a firm
~~determination, and for the commitment of which he has adopted necessary
~~measures, even if he does not succeed in committing it because of
~~certain obstruction. Thus determination is different from a suggestion
~~of the devil. The latter is excusable while one is accountable for his
~~determination. However, what is mentioned in the Hadith will happen when
~~Muslims fight among themselves for worldly honour and prejudices, and no
~~religious issue would be the cause of their conflict, because in the
~~latter case, it is possible that both might be depending on their own
~~Ijtihad (exercise of opinion) for which they may be excused.
PageV01P012
### ||| AUTO 10 - وعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله
~~عليه وسلم : [ صلاة الرجل في جماعة تزيد على صلاته في سوقه وبيته بضعا
~~وعشرين درجة وذلك أن أحدهم إذا توضأ فأحسن الوضوء ثم أتى المسجد لا يريد
~~إلا الصلاة لا ينهزه إلا الصلاة لم يخط خطوة إلا رفع بها درجة وخط عنه بها
~~خطيئة حتى يدخل المسجد فإذا دخل المسجد كان في الصلاة ما كانت الصلاة هي
~~تحبسه والملائكة يصلون على أحد كم ما دام في مجلسه الذي صلى فيه يقولون :
~~اللهم اCم اغفر له اللهم تب عليه ما لم يؤذ فيه ما لم يحدث فيه ] متفق عليه
~~. هذا لفظ مسلم
# وقوله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ ينهزه ] هو بفتح الياء والهاء وبالزاي : أي
~~يخرجه وينهضه.
# 10- Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: "The reward for Salat performed by a
~~person in congregation is more than 20 times greater than that of the
~~Salat performed in one's house or shop. When one performs Wudu'
~~perfectly and then proceeds to the mosque with the sole intention of
~~performing Salat, then for every step he takes towards the mosque, he is
~~upgraded one degree in reward and one of his sins is eliminated until he
~~enters the mosque, and when he enters the mosque, he is considered as
~~performing Salat as long as it is the Salat which prevents him (from
~~leaving the mosque); and the angels keep on supplicating Allah for him
~~as long as he remains in his place of prayer. They say: 'O Allah! have
~~mercy on him; O Allah! forgive his sins; O Allah! accept his
~~repentance'. This will carry on as long as he does not pass wind".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith shows that although it is permissible to
~~perform Salat individually in market places and houses, but its
~~collective performance in the mosque is 25, 26, or 27 times more
~~meritorious, as mentioned in other Ahadith.

### ||| AUTO 11 - وعن أبي العباس عبد الله بن عباس بن عبد المطلب رضي الله
~~عنه عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فيما يروى عن ربه تبارك وتعالى قال :
~~[ إن الله تعالى كتب الحسنات والسيئات ثم بين ذلك فمن هم بحسنة فلم يعملها

~~إلى سبعمائة ضعف إلى أضعاف كثيرة وإن هم بسيئة فلم يعملها كتبها الله عنده
~~حسنة كاملة ms003 وإن هم بها فعملها كتبها الله سيئة واحدة ] متفق عليه.
# 11- Abdullah bin `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said that Allah, the Glorious, said: "Verily,
~~Allah (SWT) has ordered that the good and the bad deeds be written down.
~~Then He explained it clearly how (to write): He who intends to do a good
~~deed but he does not do it, then Allah records it for him as a full good
~~deed, but if he carries out his intention, then Allah the Exalted,
~~writes it down for him as from ten to seven hundred folds, and even
~~more. But if he intends to do an evil act and has not done it, then
~~Allah writes it down with Him as a full good deed, but if he intends it
~~and has done it, Allah writes it down as one bad deed"
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]
# Commentary: What the Prophet (PBUH) relates to Allah is called Hadith

# `12-Abdullah bin `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with them)
~~narrated that: He heard Messenger of Allah (PBUH) as saying: "Three men,
~~amongst those who came before you, set out until night came and they
~~reached a cave, so they entered it. A rock fell down from the mountain
~~and blocked the entrance of the cave. They said: `Nothing will save you
~~from this unless you supplicate to Allah by virtue of a righteous deed
~~you have done.' Thereupon, one of them said: `O Allah! I had parents who
~~were old, and I used to offer them milk before any of my children or
~~slaves. One day, I went far away in search of grazing and could not come
~~back until they had slept. When I milked as usual and brought the drink
~~I found them both asleep. I hated to disturb them and also disliked to
~~give milk to my children before them. My children were crying out of

~~another version he said: as a man can love a woman). I wanted to have
~~sexual intercourse with her but she refused. Hard pressed in a year of
~~famine, she approached me. I gave her one hundred and twenty dinars on

~~together (for sexual intercourse), she said: Fear Allah and do not break
~~the seal unlawfully. I moved away from her in spite of the fact that I
~~loved her most passionately; and I let her keep the money I had given
~~her. O Allah! If I did that to seek Your Pleasure, then, remove the
~~distress in which we are.' The rock moved aside a bit further but they
~~were still unable to get out. The third one said: `O Allah! I hired some
~~labourers and paid them their wages except one of them departed without
~~taking his due. I invested his money in business and the business
~~prospered greatly. After a long time, he came to me and said: O slave of
~~Allah! Pay me my dues. I said: All that you see is yours - camels,
~~cattle, goats and slaves. He said: O slave of Allah! Do not mock at me.
~~I assured him that I was not joking. So he took all the things and went

~~then relieve us of our distress.' The rock slipped aside and they got
~~out walking freely".

# Commentary:
# 1- It is permissible to pray through our virtuous deeds. But to make
~~someone a medium for it, is an innovation in Deen which should be
~~avoided for two major reasons. Firstly, there is no evidence in Shari`ah
~~to support this. Secondly, it is against the practice of Khair-ul-Qurun,
~~the best of generations. (This term is used for the first three
~~generations of Muslims, the one in which the Prophet (PBUH) lived and
~~the two following).
# 2- Preference should be given to the service of parents, even over the
~~service of one's own wife and children.
# 3- To abstain from sins out of fear of Allah is a highly meritorious act.
# 4. Labourers should always be treated fairly. If someone has paid to a
~~labourer less than his due, it should be paid to him in a decent manner.
# 5. 4- Any supplication which is made sincerely, and with real sense of
~~humbleness is granted by Allah
# 6. Allah sometimes helps His pious men even in an unusual manner,
~~which is termed as Karamat (wonder or marvel). Thus, like the miracles
~~of the Prophets, wonders of the righteous people are also true. But
~~miracles and wonders both appear with the Will of Allah.

# Repentance PageV01P016
~~قال العلماء : التوبة واجبة من كل ذنب . فإن كانت المعصية بين العبد وبين
~~الله تعالى لا تتعلق بحق آدمي فلها ثلاثة شروط : أحدها أن يقلع عن المعصية
~~والثاني أن يندم على فعلها والثالث أن يعزم أن لا يعود إليها أبدا فإن فقد
~~أحد الثلاثة لم تصح توبته . وإن كانت المعصية تتعلق بآدمي فشروطها أربعة :
~~هذه الثلاثة وأن يبرأ من حق صاحبها . فأن كانت مالا أو نحوه رده إليه وإن
~~كان حد قذف ونحوه مكنه منه أو طلب عفوه وإن كانت غيبة استحله منها . ويجب
~~أن يتوب من جميع الذنوب فإن تاب من بعضها صحت توبته عند أهل الحق من ذلك
~~الذنب وبقى عليه الباقي . وقد تظاهرت دلائل الكتاب والسنة وإجماع الأمة على
~~وجوب التوبة.
# Scholars said: It is necessary to repent from every sin. If the
~~offense involves the Right of Allah, not a human, then there are three
~~condition to be met in order that repentance be accepted by Allah:
# . 1- To desist from committing it
# . 2- To feel sorry for committing it
# . 3- To decide not to recommit it3
# Any repentance failing to meet any of these three conditions, would
~~not be sound.
# But if the sin involves a human's right, it requires a fourth
~~condition, i.e., to absolve onself from such right. If it is a property,
~~he should return it to its rightful owner. If it is slandering or
~~backbiting, one should ask the pardon of the offended.
# One should also repent from all sins. If he repents from some, his
~~repentance would still be sound according to the people of sound
~~knowledge. He should, however, repent from the rest. Scriptural proofs
~~from the Book and the Sunnah and the consensus of the scholars support
~~the incumbency of repentance.

~~their wings for the seeker of knowledge out of joy for what he seeks". I
~~told him, "I have some doubts in my mind regarding wiping of wet hands
~~over light boots in the course of performing Wudu' after defecation or
~~urinating. Now since you are one of the Companions of the Prophet
~~(PBUH), I have come to ask you whether you heard any saying of the
~~Prophet (PBUH) concerning it?". He replied in the affirmative and said,
~~"He (PBUH) instructed us that during a journey we need not take off our
~~light boots for washing the feet up to three days and nights, except in
~~case of major impurity (after sexual intercourse). In other cases such
~~as sleeping, relieving oneself or urinating, the wiping of wet hands
~~over light boots will suffice.'' I, then, questioned him, "Did you hear
~~him say anything about love and affection?'' He replied, "We accompanied
~~the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) in a journey when a bedouin called out in
~~a loud voice, `O Muhammad.' The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) replied him in
~~the same tone, `Here I am.' I said to him (the bedouin), `Woe to you,
~~lower your voice in his presence, because you are not allowed to do so.'
~~He said, `By Allah! I will not lower my voice,' and then addressing the
~~Prophet (PBUH) he said, `What about a person who loves people but has
~~not found himself in their company.' Messenger of Allah (PBUH) replied,
~~`On the Day of Resurrection, a person will be in the company of those
~~whom he loves.' The Messenger of Allah then kept on talking to us and in
~~the course of his talk, he mentioned a gateway in the heaven, the width
~~of which could be crossed by a rider in forty or seventy years".
# Sufyan, one of the narrators of this tradition, said: "This gateway is
~~in the direction of Syria. Allah created it on the day He created the
~~heavens and the earth. It is open for repentance and will not be shut
~~until the sun rises from that direction (i.e., the West) (on Doomsday)".
# [At-Tirmidhi, who categorised it as Hadith Hasan Sahih]
# Commentary:
# 1- We learn from this Hadith that in ablution, it is permissible to
~~wipe over light boots rather than washing the feet. It is called Mash.
~~The period, in which Mash is intact, in case of travellers it is three
~~days and three nights; while for the residents, it is one day and one
~~night only. A precondition for it is that light boots should be clean
~~and worn after full Wudu'. Ankles should also be covered. In case of
~~breach of ablution, the wiping over the socks is sufficient, and there
~~is no need for washing the feet. Wudu' is invalidated by sleeping, call
~~of nature and passing of wind. This is called Hadath Asghar. In the case
~~of Hadath Akbar, which occurs because of coitus, menses and wet dream,
~~washing of the whole body becomes obligatory. It means that the
~~privilege of wiping over the light boots is also finished in this case,
~~in the same way as it does after the expiry of period specified for it.
# 2- One should associate himself with the pious people so that he is
~~counted among them. One also comes to know many other points from this
~~Hadith which every intelligent person can understand with a little
~~effort.

# 20. 20- Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:
~~Prophet of Allah (PBUH) said: "There was a man from among a nation
~~before you who killed ninety-nine people and then made an inquiry about
~~the most learned person on the earth. He was directed to a monk. He came
~~to him and told him that he had killed ninety-nine people and asked him
~~if there was any chance for his repentance to be accepted. He replied in
~~the negative and the man killed him also completing one hundred. He then
~~asked about the most learned man in the earth. He was directed to a
~~scholar. He told him that he had killed one hundred people and asked him
~~if there was any chance for his repentance to be accepted. He replied in
~~the affirmative and asked, `Who stands between you and repentance? Go to
~~such and such land; there (you will find) people devoted to prayer and
~~worship of Allah, join them in worship, and do not come back to your
~~land because it is an evil place.' So he went away and hardly had he
~~covered half the distance when death overtook him; and there was a
~~dispute between the angels of mercy and the angels of torment. The
~~angels of mercy pleaded, 'This man has come with a repenting heart to
~~Allah,' and the angels of punishment argued, 'He never did a virtuous
~~deed in his life.' Then there appeared another angel in the form of a
~~human being and the contending angels agreed to make him arbiter between
~~them. He said, `Measure the distance between the two lands. He will be
~~considered belonging to the land to which he is nearer.' They measured
~~and found him closer to the land (land of piety) where he intended to
~~go, and so the angels of mercy collected his soul".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# In another version: "He was found to be nearer to the locality of the
~~pious by a cubit and was thus included among them". Another version
~~says: "Allah commanded (the land which he wanted to leave) to move away
~~and commanded the other land (his destination) to draw nearer and then
~~He said: "Now measure the distance between them.' It was found that he
~~was nearer to his goal by a hand's span and was thus forgiven". It is
~~also narrated that he drew closer by a slight movement on his chest.
# Commentary:
# 1- One comes to know from this Hadith that the gate of Taubah is open
~~even for the worst of the sinners; and Allah forgives everyone provided
~~he repents sincerely, the conditions for such repentance have already
~~been discussed.
# 2- It is the duty of a religious scholar that while discussing a
~~problem, he should keep in mind the psychological aspects of the
~~questioner and adopt a policy which neither causes a change in the
~~Injunction of Allah nor make the sinner reckless in his sins out of

# 21- Abdullah bin Ka`b, who served as the guide of Ka`b bin Malik (May
~~Allah be pleased with him) when he became blind, narrated: I heard Ka`b
~~bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) narrating the story of his
~~remaining behind instead of joining Messenger of Allah (PBUH) when he
~~left for the battle of Tabuk. Ka`b said: "I accompanied Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) in every expedition which he undertook excepting the battle
~~of Tabuk and the battle of Badr. As for the battle of Badr, nobody was
~~blamed for remaining behind as Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and the
~~Muslims, when they set out, had in mind only to intercept the caravan of
~~the Quraish. Allah made them confront their enemies unexpectedly. I had
~~the honour of being with Messenger of Allah (PBUH) on the night of
~~`Aqabah when we pledged our allegiance to Islam and it was dearer to me
~~than participating in the battle of Badr, although Badr was more well-
~~known among the people than that. And this is the account of my staying
~~behind from the battle of Tabuk. I never had better means and more
~~favourable circumstances than at the time of this expedition. And by
~~Allah, I had never before possessed two riding-camels as I did during
~~the time of this expedition. Whenever Messenger of Allah (PBUH) decided
~~to go on a campaign, he would not disclose his real destination till the
~~last moment (of departure). But on this expedition, he set out in
~~extremely hot weather; the journey was long and the terrain was
~~waterless desert; and he had to face a strong army, so he informed the
~~Muslims about the actual position so that they should make full
~~preparation for the campaign. And the Muslims who accompanied Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) at that time were in large number but no proper record
~~of them was maintained.'' Ka`b (further) said: "Few were the persons who
~~chose to remain absent believing that they could easily hide themselves
~~(and thus remain undetected) unless Revelation from Allah, the Exalted,
~~and Glorious (revealed relating to them). And Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
~~set out on this expedition when the fruit were ripe and their shade was
~~sought. I had a weakness for them and it was during this season that
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and the Muslims made preparations. I also
~~would set out in the morning to make preparations along with them but
~~would come back having done nothing and said to myself: 'I have means
~~enough (to make preparations) as soon as I like'. And I went on doing
~~this (postponing my preparations) till the time of departure came and it
~~was in the morning that Messenger of Allah (PBUH) set out along with the
~~Muslims, but I had made no preparations. I would go early in the morning
~~and come back, but with no decision. I went on doing so until they (the
~~Muslims) hastened and covered a good deal of distance. Then I wished to
~~march on and join them. Would that I had done that! But perhaps it was
~~not destined for me. After the departure of Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
~~whenever I went out, I was grieved to find no good example to follow but
~~confirmed hypocrites or weak people whom Allah had exempted (from
~~marching forth for Jihad). Messenger of Allah (PBUH) made no mention of
~~me until he reached Tabuk. While he was sitting with the people in
~~Tabuk, he said, `What happened to Ka`b bin Malik?' A person from Banu
~~Salimah said: "O Messenger of Allah, the (beauty) of his cloak and an
~~appreciation of his finery have detained him.' Upon this Mu`adh bin
~~Jabal (MatAllah be pleased with him) admonished him and said to
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH): "By Allah, we know nothing about him but
~~good.' Messenger of Allah (PBUH), however, kept quiet. At that time he
~~(the Prophet (PBUH)) saw a person dressed in white and said, `Be Abu
~~Khaithamah.' And was Abu Khaithamah Al-Ansari was the person who had
~~contributed a Sa` of dates and was ridiculed by the hypocrites.'' Ka`b
~~bin Malik further said: "When the news reached me that Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) was on his way back from Tabuk, I was greatly distressed. I
~~thought of fabricating an excuse and asked myself how I would save
~~myself from his anger the next day. In this connection, I sought the
~~counsels of every prudent member of my family. When I was told that
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) was about to arrive, all the wicked ideas
~~vanished (from my mind) and I came to the conclusion that nothing but
~~the truth could save me. So I decided to tell him the truth. It was in
~~the morning that Messenger of Allah (PBUH) arrived in Al-Madinah. It was
~~his habit that whenever he came back from a journey, he would first go
~~to the mosque and perform two Rak`ah (of optional prayer) and would then
~~sit with the people. When he sat, those who had remained behind him
~~began to put forward their excuses and take an oath before him. They
~~were more than eighty in number. Messenger of Allah (PBUH) accepted
~~their excuses on the very face of them and accepted their allegiance and
~~sought forgiveness for them and left their insights to Allah, until I
~~appeared before him. I greeted him and he smiled and there was a tinge
~~of anger in that. He then said to me, 'Come forward'. I went forward and
~~I sat in front of him. He said to me, `What kept you back? Could you not
~~afford to go in for a ride?' I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, by Allah, if
~~I were to sit before anybody else, a man of the world, I would have
~~definitely saved myself from his anger on one pretext or the other and I
~~have a gifted skill in argumentation, but, by Allah, I am fully aware
~~that if I were to put forward before you a lame excuse to please you,
~~Allah would definitely provoke your wrath upon me. In case, I speak the
~~truth, you may be angry with me, but I hope that Allah would be pleased
~~with me (and accept my repentance). By Allah, there is no valid excuse
~~for me. By Allah, I never possessed so good means, and I never had such
~~favourable conditions for me as I had when I stayed behind.' Thereupon,
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, 'This man spoke the truth, so get up
~~(and wait) until Allah gives a decision about you.' I left and some
~~people of Banu Salimah followed me. They said to me, `By Allah, we do
~~not know that you committed a sin before. You, however, showed inability
~~to put forward an excuse before Messenger of Allah (PBUH) like those who
~~stayed behind him. It would have been enough for the forgiveness of your
~~sin that Messenger of Allah (PBUH) would have sought forgiveness for
~~you.' By Allah, they kept on reproaching me until I thought of going
~~back to Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and retract my confession. Then I said
~~to them, 'Has anyone else met the same fate?' They said, 'Yes, two
~~persons have met the same fate. They made the same statement as you did
~~and the same verdict was delivered in their case.' I asked, `Who are
~~they?' They said, 'Murarah bin Ar-Rabi` Al-`Amri and Hilal bin Umaiyyah
~~Al-Waqifi.' They mentioned these two pious men who had taken part in the
~~battle of Badr and there was an example for me in them. I was confirmed
~~in my original resolve. Messenger of Allah (PBUH) prohibited the Muslims
~~to talk to the three of us from amongst those who had stayed behind. The
~~people began to avoid us and their attitude towards us changed and it
~~seemed as if the whole atmosphere had turned against us, and it was in
~~fact the same atmosphere of which I was fully aware and in which I had
~~lived (for a fairly long time). We spent fifty nights in this very state
~~and my two friends confined themselves within their houses and spent
~~(most of their) time weeping. As I was the youngest and the strongest, I
~~would leave my house, attend the congregational Salat, move about in the
~~bazaars, but none would speak to me. I would come to Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) as he sat amongst (people) after the Salat, greet him and would
~~ask myself whether or not his lips moved in response to my greetings.
~~Then I would perform Salat near him and look at him stealthily. When I
~~finish my Salat, he would look at me and when I would cast a glance at
~~him he would turn away his eyes from me. When the harsh treatment of the
~~Muslims to me continued for a (considerable) length of time, I walked
~~and I climbed upon the wall of the garden of Abu Qatadah, who was my
~~cousin, and I had a great love for him. I greeted him but, by Allah, he
~~did not answer to my greeting. I said to him, `O Abu Qatadah, I adjure
~~you in the Name of Allah, are you not aware that I love Allah and His
~~Messenger (PBUH)?' I asked him the same question again but he remained
~~silent. I again adjured him, whereupon he said, `Allah and His Messenger
~~(PBUH) know better.' My eyes were filled with tears, and I came back
~~climbing down the wall.
# As I was walking in the bazaars of Al-Madinah, a man from the Syrian
~~peasants, who had come to sell food grains in Al-Madinah, asked people
~~to direct him to Ka`b bin Malik. People pointed towards me. He came to
~~me and delivered a letter from the King of Ghassan, and as I was a
~~scribe, I read that letter whose purport was: `It has been conveyed to
~~us that your friend (the Prophet (PBUH)) was treating you harshly. Allah
~~has not created you for a place where you are to be degraded and where
~~you cannot find your right place; so come to us and we shall receive you
~~graciously.' As I read that letter I said: 'This is too a trial,' so I
~~put it to fire in an oven. When forty days had elapsed and Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) received no Revelation, there came to me a messenger of the
~~Messenger of Allah and said, `Verily, Messenger of Allah (PBUH) has
~~commanded you to keep away from your wife.' I said, `Should I divorce
~~her or what else should I do?' He said, `No, but only keep away from her
~~and don't have sexual contact with her.' The same message was sent to my
~~companions. So, I said to my wife: 'You better go to your parents and
~~stay there with them until Allah gives the decision in my case.' The
~~wife of Hilal bin Umaiyyah came to Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and said:
~~'O Messenger of Allah, Hilal bin Umaiyyah is a senile person and has no
~~servant. Do you disapprove if I serve him?' He said, `No, but don't let
~~him have any sexual contact with you.' She said, 'By Allah, he has no
~~such desire left in him. By Allah, he has been in tears since (this
~~calamity) struck him.' Members of my family said to me, `You should have
~~sought permission from Messenger of Allah (PBUH) in regard to your wife.
~~He has allowed the wife of Hilal bin Umaiyyah to serve him.' I said, 'I
~~would not seek permission from Messenger of Allah (PBUH) for I do not
~~know what Messenger of Allah might say in response to that, as I am a
~~young man'. It was in this state that I spent ten more nights and thus
~~fifty days had passed since people boycotted us and gave up talking to
~~us. After I had offered my Fajr prayer on the early morning of the
~~fiftieth day of this boycott on the roof of one of our houses, and had
~~sat in the very state which Allah described as: `The earth seemed
~~constrained for me despite its vastness', I heard the voice of a
~~proclaimer from the peak of the hill Sal` shouting at the top of his
~~voice: 'O Ka`b bin Malik, rejoice.' I fell down in prostration and came
~~to know that there was (a message of) relief for me. Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) had informed the people about the acceptance of our repentance by
~~Allah after he had offered the Fajr prayer. So the people went on to
~~give us glad tidings and some of them went to my companions in order to
~~give them the glad tidings. A man spurred his horse towards me (to give
~~the good news), and another one from the tribe of Aslam came running for
~~the same purpose and, as he approached the mount, I received the good
~~news which reached me before the rider did. When the one whose voice I
~~had heard came to me to congratulate me, I took off my garments and gave
~~them to him for the good news he brought to me. By Allah, I possessed
~~nothing else (in the form of clothes) except these garments, at that
~~time. Then I borrowed two garments, dressed myself and came to Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) On my way, I met groups of people who greeted me for
~~(the acceptance of) repentance and they said: 'Congratulations for
~~acceptance of your repentance.' I reached the mosque where Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) was sitting amidst people. Talhah bin `Ubaidullah got up
~~and rushed towards me, shook hands with me and greeted me. By Allah, no
~~person stood up (to greet me) from amongst the Muhajirun besides him.''
~~Ka`b said that he never forgot (this good gesture of) Talhah. Ka`b
~~further said: "I greeted Messenger of Allah (PBUH) with `As-salamu
~~`alaikum' and his face was beaming with pleasure. He (PBUH) said,
~~`Rejoice with the best day you have ever seen since your mother gave you
~~birth. 'I said: `O Messenger of Allah! Is this (good news) from you or
~~from Allah?' He said, `No, it is from Allah.' And it was common with
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) that when ever he was happy, his face would
~~glow as if it were a part of the moon and it was from this that we
~~recognized it (his delight). As I sat before him, I said, I have placed
~~a condition upon myself that if Allah accepts my Taubah, I would give up
~~all of my property in charity for the sake of Allah and His Messenger
~~(PBUH)!' Thereupon Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, `Keep some property
~~with you, as it is better for you.' I said, 'I shall keep with me that
~~portion which is in Khaibar'. I added: 'O Messenger of Allah! Verily,
~~Allah has granted me salvation because of my truthfulness, and
~~therefore, repentance obliges me to speak nothing but the truth as long
~~as I am alive.'' Ka`b added: "By Allah, I do not know anyone among the
~~Muslims who has been granted truthfulness better than me since I said
~~this to the Prophet (PBUH). By Allah! Since the time I made a pledge of
~~this to Messenger of Allah (PBUH), I have never intended to tell a lie,
~~and I hope that Allah would protect me (against telling lies) for the
~~rest of my life. Allah, the Exalted, the Glorious, revealed these
~~Verses:
# 'Allah has forgiven the Prophet (PBUH), the Muhajirun (Muslim
~~Emigrants who left their homes and came to Al-Madinah) and the Ansar
~~(Muslims of Al-Madinah) who followed him (Muhammad (PBUH)) in the time
~~of distress (Tabuk expedition), after the hearts of a party of them had
~~nearly deviated (from the Right Path), but He accepted their repentance.
~~Certainly, He is unto them full of kindness, Most Merciful. And (He did
~~forgive also) the three who did not join [the Tabuk expedition and whose
~~case was deferred (by the Prophet (PBUH)) for Allah's Decision] till for
~~them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened and their ownselves were
~~straitened to them, and they perceived that there is no fleeing from
~~Allah, and no refuge but with Him. Then, He forgave them (accepted their
~~repentance), that they might beg for His Pardon [repent (unto Him)].
~~Verily, Allah is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most
~~Merciful. O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah, and be with those who
~~are true (in word and deeds).'' (9:117,118).
# Ka`b said: "By Allah, since Allah guided me to Islam, there has been
~~no blessing more significant for me than this truth of mine which I
~~spoke to Messenger of Allah (PBUH), and if I were to tell a lie I would
~~have been ruined as were ruined those who had told lies, for Allah
~~described those who told lies with the worst description He ever
~~attributed to anybody else, as He sent down the Revelation:
# They will swear by Allah to you (Muslims) when you return to them,
~~that you may turn away from them. So turn away from them. Surely, they
~~are Rijsun [i.e., Najasun (impure) because of their evil deeds], and
~~Hell is their dwelling place - a recompense for that which they used to
~~earn. They (the hypocrites) swear to you (Muslims) that you may be
~~pleased with them, but if you are pleased with them, certainly Allah is
~~not pleased with the people who are Al-Fa'siqun (rebellious, disobedient
~~to Allah)". (9:95,96)
# Ka`b further added: "The matter of the three of us remained pending
~~for decision apart from the case of those who had made excuses on oath
~~before Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and he accepted those, took fresh oaths
~~of allegiance from them and supplicated for their forgiveness. The
~~Prophet (PBUH) kept our matter pending till Allah decided it. The three
~~whose matter was deferred have been shown mercy. The reference here is
~~not to our staying back from the expedition but to his delaying our
~~matter and keeping it pending beyond the matter of those who made their
~~excuses on oath which he accepted".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]
# Another version adds: "Messenger of Allah (PBUH) set out for Tabuk on
~~Thursday. He used to prefer to set out on journey on Thursday.'' Another
~~version says: "Messenger of Allah (PBUH) used to come back from a
~~journey in the early forenoon and went straight to the mosque where he
~~would perform two Rak`ah prayer. Afterwards he would seat himself
~~there".
# Commentary: This Hadith contains many aspects of warnings and advices,
~~some of which are given below:
# 1- A Muslim should always speak the truth even if he has to face
~~troubles and turmoil for it because the Pleasure of Allah lies in truth
# 2- One must avoid at all costs the attitude of hypocrites because
~~eventually one is ruined by it.
# 3- In spite of hardship and stringency, one must take part in Jihad.
# 4- For the admonition and exhortation of others, it gives
~~justification for the economic boycott of even sincere Muslims who adopt
~~wrong methods.
# 5- One must face with forbearance the difficulties which come in the
~~way of Deen.
# 6- It is not praiseworthy that one gives in charity all the property
~~he has. One must keep what is needed for the lawful needs.
# 7- It is lawful to give something by way of gift and reward to a
~~person who congratulates in the events of happiness.8- The ability to
~~seek pardon is a gift from Allah for which one must express gratitude to Him.
# .9- Any promise that one makes must be kept, etc. etc

~~reported: A woman from the tribe Juhainah came to Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) while she was pregnant from (Zina) adultery and said to him: "O
~~Messenger of Allah! I have committed an offense liable to Hadd
~~(prescribed punishment), so exact the execution of the sentence.''
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) called her guardian and said to him, "Treat
~~her kindly. Bring her to me after the delivery of the child.'' That man
~~complied with the orders. At last the Prophet (PBUH) commanded to carry
~~out the sentence. Her clothes were secured around her and she was stoned
~~to death. The Prophet (PBUH) led her funeral prayers. `Umar submitted:
~~"O Messenger of Allah! She committed Zina and you have performed funeral
~~prayer for her?'' He replied, "Verily, she made repentance which would
~~suffice for seventy of the people of Al-Madinah if it is divided among

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith highlights the following five points:
# 1. It confirms the validity of the punishment of Rajm for the
~~adulterer, that is to say that he should be stoned to death.
# 2. The merit of sincere pardon.
# 3.The description of fear of Allah as well as of accountability on the
~~Day of Resurrection by the Prophet's Companions, and their preference
~~for punishment of sins in this world rather than in the Hereafter.
# 4. It is permissible to perform the funeral prayer of one who has been
~~guilty of major sins, provided he has not been taking them as lawful
~~because in that case there is danger of disbelief..
# 5. A pregnant woman cannot be punished with Rajm until she gives birth
~~to the child and the period specified for suckling the baby is

~~30. 30- Suhaib (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that the
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "There lived a king before you and he
~~had a court magician. As he (the magician) grew old, he said to the
~~king: `I have grown old, so send me a young boy in order to teach him
~~magic.' The king sent him a young boy to serve the purpose. And on his
~~way (to the magician) the young boy met a monk to whom he listened to
~~and liked it. It became his habit that on his way to the magician, he
~~would meet the monk and sit there and would come to the magician (late).
~~The magician used to beat him because of this delay. He complained about
~~this to the monk who said to him: 'When you feel afraid of the magician,
~~say: Members of my family detained me. And when you fear your family,
~~say: The magician detained me.' It so happened that there came a huge
~~beast and it blocked the way of the people, and the young boy said: 'I
~~will know today whether the magician or the monk is better.' He picked
~~up a stone and said: `O Allah, if the way of the monk is dearer to You
~~than the way of the magician, bring about death to the animal so that
~~the people be able to move about freely.' He threw that stone at it and
~~killed it and the people began to move about freely. He then came to the
~~monk and told him the story. The monk said: `Son, today you are superior
~~to me. You have come to a stage where I feel that you would be soon put
~~to a trial, and in case you are put to a trial, do not reveal me.' That
~~young boy began to heal those born blind and the lepers and he, in fact,
~~began to cure people from all kinds of illnesses. When a courtier of the
~~king who had gone blind heard about him, he came to him with numerous
~~gifts and said, `If you cure me, all these things will be yours.' He
~~said, `I myself do not cure anyone. It is Allah, the Exalted, Alone Who
~~cures; and if you affirm faith in Allah, I shall also supplicate to
~~Allah to cure you.' This courtier affirmed his faith in Allah and Allah
~~cured him. He came to the king and sat by his side as he used to sit
~~before. The king said to him, `Who restored your eyesight?' He said, `My
~~Rubb.' Thereupon he said, 'Do you have another lord besides me?' He
~~said, `My Rubb and your Rubb is Allah.' So the king kept torturing him
~~untill he revealed the young boy. The young boy was thus summoned and
~~the king said to him, 'O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have
~~become so much proficient in your magic that you cure the blind and the
~~lepers and you do such and such.' Thereupon he said, `I do not cure
~~anyone; it is Allah Alone Who cures,' and the king took hold of him and
~~began to torture him until he revealed of the monk. The monk was
~~summoned and it was said to him: `You should turn back from your
~~religion.' But he refused. The king sent for a saw, placed it in the
~~middle of his head and cut him into two parts that fell down. Then the
~~courtier of the king was brought forward and it was said to him: `Turn
~~back from your religion.' He, too, refused, and the saw was placed in
~~the midst of his head and he was torn into two parts. Then the boy was
~~sent for and it was said to him: `Turn back from your religion.' He
~~refused. The king then handed him over to a group of his courtiers, and
~~said to them: `Take him to such and such mountain; make him climb up
~~that mountain and when you reach its peak ask him to renounce his Faith.
~~If he refuses to do so, push him to his death.' So they took him and
~~made him climb up the mountain and he said: `O Allah, save me from them
~~in any way you like,' and the mountain began to shake and they all fell
~~down (dead) and that young boy came walking to the king. The king said
~~to him, `What happened to your companions?' He said, `Allah has saved me
~~from them.' He again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: `Take
~~him and carry him in a boat and when you reach the middle of the sea,
~~ask him to renounce his religion. If he does not renounce his religion
~~throw him (into the water).' So they took him and he said: `O Allah,
~~save me from them.' The boat turned upside down and they all drowned
~~except the young boy who came walking to the king. The king said to him,
~~`What happened to your companions?' He said, `Allah has saved me from
~~them,' and he said to the king: `You cannot kill me until you do what I
~~command you to do.' The king asked, `What is that?' He said, `Gather all
~~people in one place and tie me up to the trunk of a tree, then take an
~~arrow from my quiver and say: With the Name of Allah, the Rubb of the
~~boy; then shoot me. If you do that you will be able to kill me.' `The
~~king called the people in an open field and tied the young boy to the
~~trunk of a tree. He took out an arrow from his quiver, fixed in the bow
~~and said, `With the Name of Allah, the Rubb of the young boy,' he then
~~shot the arrow and it hit the boy's temple. The young boy placed his
~~hand upon the temple where the arrow had hit him and died. The people
~~then said: `We believe in the Rubb of this young boy.' The king was
~~told: `Do you see what you were afraid of, by Allah it has taken place;
~~all people have believed.' The king then commanded that trenches be dug
~~and fire lit in them, and said: `He who would not turn back from his
~~(the young boy's) religion, throw him in the fire' or `he would be
~~ordered to jump into it.' They did so till a woman came with her child.
~~She felt hesitant in jumping into the fire. The child said to her: `O
~~mother! Endure (this ordeal) for you are on the Right Path".
# [Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. The most important lesson of this Hadith is that whatever
~~difficulties one has to face on the path of Deen, he should endure it
~~with patience and determination; and if interest of the Deen requires,
~~one should sacrifice his life for it.
# 2. The wonders displayed by righteous people are true. When Allah's
~~Will and Wisdom requires, He manifests these wonders through His slaves.
# 3. It is a proof of the truth of the Qur'an that it has retold the
~~great historical event like Ashab-ul-Ukhdud which, buried in the dust of
~~ages, had long been forgotten.
# 4. It is not possible to explain and interpret the Qur'an without the
~~help of Ahadith. The event of Ashsb-ul-Ukhdud mentioned in the Qur'an is
~~an instance in point. It is the Hadith that has brought into light the
~~details of the event and clarified its ambiguity.
# 5. Such incidents are a source of strength for the faith of true
~~believers.

# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: To endure patiently in a city where one resides when it is
~~affected by plague or such other epidemics, and not to flee from it,
~~elevates a Muslim to the level of Shahadah in the way of Allah, as is
~~the case in certain other circumstances, like death by drowning or in
~~maternity, etc. This order is based on the consideration that the
~~epidemic should not spread to other cities. On the other hand, residents

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith mentions the special Grace and Mercy of Allah
~~for the Muslims. It relates how Allah turns the hardships and troubles
~~suffered by a Muslim into a means of expiation for his sins. But this is
~~only possible if the believer exercises patience. However, if he starts

~~would be deprived of the reward which lies in bearing them patiently.

~~suffering greatly, O Messenger of Allah.'' The Prophet (PBUH) replied,
~~"Yes, I suffer as much as two persons.'' I said, "Is that because you

~~fall away just as a tree sheds its leaves".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: Since man has no knowledge of his future, whether it is
~~good or bad, so one should never desire for one's own death in
~~consequence of frustration created by troubles and turmoil for two
~~reasons. Firstly, desire for death is sheer impatience. Secondly, it is
~~quite possible that remaining part of his life may be good for his
~~religious and worldly life. So, it is prohibited to desire death. It is,
~~however, permissible to desire for Shahadah or death in Makkah or Al-
~~Madinah but it is a subject quite different from the one under

~~We complained to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) regarding the persecution
~~inflicted upon us by the disbelievers while he was lying in the shade of

~~not supplicate for our prevalence (over the opponents)?''. He (PBUH)

# [Al-Bukhari].
# Another narration is: He (PBUH) had placed his cloak under his head
~~and we had been tortured by the polytheists.
# Commentary:
# . 1- Difficulties in the path of Faith do not come in any particular
~~period. People devoted to their Deen have passed through trials and
~~tribulations everywhere and in every age and have emerged purified as
~~does the gold after passing through the furnace. So, it is unbecoming
~~for a Muslim to be disturbed by hardships.

# . 42- Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: After the

~~distribution of spoils (for consolation). He gave Al-Aqra` bin Habis and
~~`Uyainah bin Hisn a hundred camels each and showed favour also to some

~~not based on justice and it was not intended to win the Pleasure of

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith leads to the conclusion that the leader of the
~~people or the calipha has a right, if situation demands, to give to the
~~new Muslims and other influential and respectable people of the society
~~more than others for their satisfaction and encouragement. The man who
~~raised objection on the distribution of booty by the Prophet (PBUH) was
~~a hypocrite. Devout Muslims could never think that the Prophet (PBUH)
~~could be unjust to anyone. This incident also goes to prove that the
~~Prophet (PBUH) also felt as much as others did, the things which
~~infuriated or pleased others, because he was a man and not a superhuman being.

# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: This Hadith shows that, for a Muslim, trials are also a
~~blessing in this world because his sins are forgiven in proportion to
~~the trials he has to face and his reward is increased with the Will of
~~Allah. Thus, a Muslim should always be patient and contented in the

~~out and the boy died in his absence. When he came back, he inquired,
~~"How is the boy?''. Umm Sulaim, the mother of the boy, replied, "Better
~~than before". Then she placed his evening meal before him and he ate it;
~~and thereafter slept with her. At last, she said to him: "Arrange for
~~the burial of the boy". In the morning, Abu Talhah went to Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) and informed him of the event. He enquired, "Did you sleep
~~together last night?'' Abu Talhah replied in the affirmative, on which
~~the Prophet (PBUH) supplicated, "O Allah bless them.'' Thereafter, she
~~gave birth to a boy. Abu Talhah said to me: "Take up the boy and carry
~~him to the Prophet (PBUH)''; and he sent some dates with him. The
~~Prophet (PBUH) enquired, "Is there anything with him?'' He said; "Yes,
~~some dates". The Prophet (PBUH) took a date, chewed it and put it in the

~~named him `Abdullah.
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# The narration in Bukhari adds: Ibn `Uyainah relates that a man from
~~the Ansar told him that he had seen nine sons of this `Abdullah, every
~~one of whom had committed the Noble Qur'an to memory.
# The narration of Muslim says: The son of Abu Talhah (May Allah be
~~pleased with him) who was born of Umm Sulaim died. She (Umm Sulaim) said
~~to the members of the family: "Do not tell Abu Talhah about his son
~~until I mention it to him myself.'' Abu Talhah came (home) and she gave
~~him supper. He ate and drank. She then beautified herself the best way
~~she ever did and he slept with her. When she saw that he was satisfied
~~after sexual intercourse with her, she said, "O Abu Talhah! If some
~~people borrow something from another family and then (the members of the
~~family) ask for its return, would they refuse to give it back to them.''
~~He said, "No". She said, "Then hope reward for your son". Abu Talhah got
~~angry, and said; "You left me uninformed until I stained myself (with
~~sexual intercourse) and then you told me about my son. "He went to
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and informed him about the matter. Thereupon
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "May Allah bless the night you spent
~~together!'' He (the narrator) said: She conceived. (One day) Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) was in the course of a journey and she was along with
~~him. When Messenger of Allah (PBUH) used to come back to Al-Madinah from
~~a journey, he would not enter it (during the night). When the people
~~came near Al-Madinah, she felt labour pains. He (Abu Talhah) remained
~~with her and Messenger of Allah (PBUH) proceeded on. Abu Talhah said: "O
~~Rubb, You know that I love to go along with Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
~~when he goes out and enter along with him when he enters, and I have
~~been detained as You see.'' Umm Sulaim then said: "O Abu Talhah, I do
~~not feel (so much pain) as I was feeling earlier, so we better proceed
~~on. So we proceeded on and she felt the labour of delivery as they
~~reached (Al-Madinah). She gave birth to a male child. My mother said to
~~me: "O Anas, none should suckle him until you go to Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) tomorrow morning.'' The next morning I carried the baby with me
~~to Messenger of Allah (PBUH), and narrated the rest of the story.
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith has many lessons for our social life. For
~~instance:
# 1. The character of a woman of great patience and gratitude is
~~mentioned here. In spite of the death of her child she neither wept and
~~cried nor did she moan and mourn. She was patient to the extent that
~~when her husband came home she looked after all his needs like a loving
~~and obedient wife does and then broke the sad news of the death of their
~~child in a noble manner. Thus, this Hadith holds the lesson that it is
~~the foremost duty of a wife that she should serve her husband well and
~~provide comfort and peace of mind to him.
# 2. It is meritorious for a wife to beautify herself at home for her
~~husband.
# 3. One who in his trouble is contented with the Will of Allah,
~~certainly gets a reward for it from Him.
# 4. Women can also take part with men in Jihad and within the
~~prescribed limits render to Mujahidun (warriors in the cause of
~~religion) the services such as dressing of the wounded, welfare of the
~~patients, supply of food, etc.

# Commentary:
# 1. In this Hadith, the word `Qurra' does not stand for the kind of the
~~`Qurra' (reciters) of the present age who are only professional in the
~~art of reciting the Qur'an and have a melodious voice, but what it
~~really meant was the class of scholars who were well-versed in its
~~meanings and implications and who could thoroughly distinguish between
~~the lawful and the unlawful, fair and foul. Such men used to be the
~~companions of the early noble caliphs. It leads to the conclusion that
~~rulers should choose their advisors from religious scholars and not from
~~those who are given to the world and whose sole aim in life is to amass
~~wealth rather than care about the welfare of the people and whose advice
~~is based on selfish motives and vested interests.
# 2. Since scholarship and piousness are the foremost qualifications for
~~counsellors and advisors, there is no restriction of age for them.

~~someone whose truth has become his second nature; and in the opposite
~~case, one is a liar who is in the habit of telling lies. As one acquires
~~a reputation in this world for his good or bad deeds similar is his
~~position before Allah. One who is ranked among the truthful with Him is

~~He collected the spoils and it (meaning fire) came to devour these, but

~~They brought him a head of gold like a cow's head and when he laid it
~~down, the fire came and devoured the spoils. Spoils were not allowed to
~~anyone before us, then Allah allowed spoils to us as He saw our weakness

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. In the opinion of Imam As-Suyuti, the Prophet (PBUH) referred to in

# 2. The lawfulness of the booty of war fought in the way of Allah is a

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: Here, the two persons engaged in business are seller and

~~Islam". He (PBUH)replied, "Islam is to testify that none has the right
~~to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad (PBUH) is the Messenger of
~~Allah; that you observe Salat (prayers), pay Zakat, observe Saum
~~(fasting) of Ramadan and perform Hajj (pilgrimage) of the House,
~~provided you have resources of making journey to it.'' He replied: "You
~~have spoken the truth". We were surprised to see that he had asked him
~~and confirmed the correctness of the answers. He then enquired: "Tell me
~~about Iman". He (PBUH) said. "It is to believe in Allah, and His Books,
~~and His Messengers and the Last Day and that you believe in
~~foreordainment, its bad and good consequences.'' He said, "You have
~~spoken the truth.'' He then enquired: "Tell me about Ihsan.'' He (PBUH)
~~said, "It is to worship Allah as if you are seeing Him; and although you
~~do not see Him, He sees you". He enquired: "Inform me about the Hour
~~(i.e., the Day of Resurrection)". He (PBUH) replied, "I have no more
~~knowledge thereof than you". He said, "Inform me about some of its
~~signs". He (PBUH) said, "They are - that a bondswoman gives birth to her
~~own master, and that you will find the barefooted, naked, poor shepherds
~~competing one another in the construction of higher buildings". Then he
~~departed. The Messenger of Allah kept silent for a while then he said to

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith is known as 'Hadith Jibril'. It mentions the

~~(Divine foreordainment) means that Allah already knows and had recorded
~~everything that will happen until the Day of Resurrection. Now whatever
~~happens is in accordance with that knowledge and writing. What is meant
~~by its good and bad consequences can be illustrated by saying that
~~tranquillity, prosperity and abundance of crops come in the category of
~~good consequences. Famine, calamities and troubles, etc., fall in the
~~list as evil consequences. But we regard them good or bad according to
~~our own understanding; otherwise, every action of Allah has some wisdom

~~hair and to be rid of what makes me loathsome to people". The angel ran
~~his hand over him and he was given good hair. He then asked him what
~~property he would like best. He replied that he would like cattle, so he
~~was given a pregnant cow. The angel invoked Allah's Blessing on it. The
~~angel then went to the blind man and asked him what he would like best,
~~and he replied: "I wish that Allah restore my sight to me so that I may
~~see people.'' Thereupon the angel ran his hand over him and Allah
~~restored his sight. The angel then asked what property he would like
~~best. He replied that he would like sheep, so he was given a pregnant
~~ewe. Flocks and herds were produced for the three men, the first having
~~a valley full of camels, the second one, a valley full of cows and the
~~third one full of sheep. Then the angel came in the form of a leper, to
~~the one who had been a leper, and said: "I am a poor man and my

~~reaching my destination are dependent on Allah and then on you, so I ask
~~you by Him Who gave you the good colour, the good skin and the property,
~~for a camel by which I may get to my destination". He replied: "I have
~~many dues to pay.'' The angel then said: "I think I recognize you. Were
~~you not a leper whom people found loathsome and a poor man to whom Allah
~~gave property?'' He replied: "I inherited this property through
~~generations". The angel said: "If you are telling a lie, may Allah
~~return you to your former condition". The angel went in the form of a
~~bald man to the one who had been bald, and said the same as he had said
~~to the former and received a similar reply. So he said: "If you are
~~telling a lie, may Allah return you to your former condition". The angel
~~then went to the one who had been blind and said: "I am a poor traveller
~~and my resources have been exhausted in my journey. My only means of
~~reaching my destination are dependant on Allah and then on you, so I ask
~~you by Him Who restored your eyesight for a sheep by which I may get to
~~the end of my journey". He replied: "Yes, I was blind. Allah restored my
~~eyesight, so take what you wish and leave what you wish. I swear by
~~Allah that I shall not argue with you today to return anything you take,
~~as I give it for Allah's sake". The angel said: "Keep your property. You
~~have all simply been put to a test, and Allah is pleased with you and
~~displeased with both of your companions".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith tells us that abundance of property and wealth
~~is also a trial. He alone succeeds in this trial who in the midst of his
~~riches does not forget about Allah's Status and his own status. Rather
~~than becoming proud of his wealth, he takes pleasure in spending it in
~~fulfilling the needs of people and expresses gratitude to Him in
~~practical terms. Those who take an opposite course are regarded
~~unsuccessful because on account of their wrong attitude, they tend to
~~falsehood, pride and miserliness which cause the displeasure of Allah..

# Commentary: Besides the Prophet's habit of pardoning, and gracious
~~attitude, this Hadith mentions his utmost trust in Allah. It tells that
~~one who has trust in Allah is helped by Him. Later on, the bedouin
~~mentioned in the Hadith embraced Islam. In the battle of Dhat-ur-Riqa`
~~which took place in the sixth year of the Hijra, due to intense heat and
~~lack of footwear, the Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) wrapped their
~~feet with pieces of cloth and for this reason it was called "War of
~~patches of cloth (Dhat-ur-Riqa`)''. Some scholars have also given a
~~different reason for this name.

~~that I might be called for. However, Messenger of Allah (PBUH) called
~~`Ali bin Abu Talib (May Allah be pleased with him) and handed the banner
~~to him and said, "Go forth and do not turn around till Allah bestows
~~victory upon you". (On hearing this) `Ali proceeded a little and then
~~halted and without turning around inquired in a loud voice: "O Messenger
~~of Allah, for what shall I fight them?'' He (PBUH) replied, "Go on
~~fighting till they affirm that none has the right to be worshiped but
~~Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. If they admit that,
~~their lives and their properties will be secured, subject to their
~~obligations according to Islam, and they will be answerable to Allah".
# [Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. This Hadith refers to prominence, special distinction and greatness
~~of `Ali (May Allah be pleased with him).
# 2. It mentions the miracle of the Prophet (PBUH) in the form of his
~~prophecy about the conquest of Khaibar which came true.
# 3. Islamic sanctions would be applied on the apparent conduct of the
~~people. Thus, a person who would announce his acceptance of Islam, will
~~be considered a Muslim. What is hidden in his heart will be left to
~~Allah. He will, however, be punished with retaliation (Qisas) in case of
~~unjust murder and execution for apostasy.

~~يزال عبدي يتقرب إلي بالنوافل حتى أحبه : فإذا أحببته كنت سمعه الذي يسمع

# 95. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) said, "Allah the Exalted has said: 'I will declare war
~~against him who shows hostility to a pious worshipper of Mine. And the
~~most beloved thing with which My slave comes nearer to Me is what I have
~~enjoined upon him; and My slave keeps on coming closer to Me through
~~performing Nawafil (prayer or doing extra deeds besides what is
~~obligatory) till I love him. When I love him I become his hearing with
~~which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he
~~strikes, and his leg with which he walks; and if he asks (something)
~~from Me, I give him, and if he asks My Protection (refuge), I protect him".
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary:
# 1. Those who make innovations in religion and associate partners with
~~Allah (such as Hululi - who believe in the indwelling light in the soul
~~of man, Wujudi - who believe in the physical form of Allah, and pagans
~~who worship other than Allah) interpret this Hadith in support of their
~~beliefs and thus seek support of one wrong from another although the
~~meaning and interpretation of the Hadith is not at all what they
~~describe. The Hadith means that when a person adds voluntary prayers to
~~the obligatory ones, he becomes a favourite slave of Allah and on
~~account of it, he receives special help from Allah. Then he is protected
~~by Allah to the extent that He supervises every organ of his body. Thus,
~~he is saved from disobedience of Allah. He bears what is liked by Allah,
~~sees what is liked by Him, handles what pleases Him. When he attains
~~that lofty position of love and obedience of Allah, then Allah in return
~~also grants prayers of His obedient and loyal slaves.
# 2. A saint is not one who has a peculiar attire and appearance, or who
~~occupies the seat of a righteous as his successor, or a person who is
~~lost in meditation, or a half-mad, or one who has invented his own style
~~of remembrance and worship of Allah, but it is one who strictly fulfills
~~the obligations imposed by Islam, is fond of voluntary prayers and
~~adheres to Divine injunctions in every walk of life.
# 3. The love of such righteous is a means to attain the Pleasure of
~~Allah, and enmity (hatred and repulsion) with them is a cause of His
~~serious displeasure and wrath.
# 4. Voluntary prayer is certainly a means of attaining the Pleasure of
~~Allah, but it must be preceded by the fulfillment of obligatory prayers.
~~The former is of no value if the latter is neglected. The desire to
~~attain nearness of Allah without strict observance of the obligatory
~~prayers is fallacious and meaningless.

~~Allah (PBUH) said, "There are two blessings in which many people incur
~~loss. (They are) health and free time (for doing good)".
# [Al-Bukhari]
# Commentary:
# 1. Al-Ghabn in Arabic means loss. What it really signifies is to sell
~~something of one's own on less than its due price, or to buy something
~~on its double or triple price. In both cases one is a loser. When a
~~person comes to know about such a loss, he repents and feels sorry for
~~it. This loss coupled with regret is called Al-Ghabn. In Ahadith, man
~~has been compared with trader, and health and leisure enjoyed by him
~~with merchandise. One who uses his merchandise with care, gains profit
~~while he who wastes it, that is to say, uses it carelessly, will be a
~~loser on the Day of Resurrection.
# 2. The majority of people do not take proper care of both these
~~things, with the result that one wastes the time in useless activities
~~and spends the physical strength and energy in the disobedience of
~~Allah. One will have to face severe consequences of it on the Day of
~~Resurrection when he will be brought into account for everything.

# 98. `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (PBUH)

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. All the Prophets were free from major sins. However, some religious
~~scholars justify some of their minor sins with plausible reasons but the
~~majority of them maintain that they are free from all sins because of
~~their innocence. In this situation, it does not make any sense to speak
~~of their sins. But the fact of the matter is quite different. Anything
~~short of excellent done by them is counted as a sin.
# 2. The more one is rewarded by Allah, the greater the proportion of
~~one's gratitude of Allah for His Benevolence should be. The best form of
~~doing so is that one should not only be highly obedient and dutiful in

# 100. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger

# [Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. In this Hadith, goodness is acknowledged in weak as well as strong
~~because the real Faith is a common feature of both. The one who is
~~stronger is, however, better with Allah for the reason that he is more
~~active and energetic in the matter of noble deeds and performance of

# 2. This Hadith ordains that in case of trouble, one should exercise

# 102. Hudhaifah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I offered
~~Salat (Tahajjud - optional night prayer) with the Prophet (PBUH) one
~~night, and he started reciting (Surat) Al-Baqarah. I thought that he
~~would bow at the end of one hundred Verses, but he continued reciting;
~~I, then, thought that he would perhaps recite the whole (Surah) in a

~~then started (Surat) Al-`Imran and his recitation was unhurried. And
~~when he recited the Verses which referred to the Glory of Allah, he
~~glorified Him (by saying Subhan Allah - My Rubb, the Supreme is far
~~removed from every imperfection), the Great, and when he recited the
~~Verses that mention supplication, he supplicated, and when he recited
~~the Verses that mention seeking Refuge of the Rubb, he sought (His)
~~Refuge. Then he bowed and said: "My Rubb, the Supreme is far removed
~~from every imperfection (Subhana Rabbiyal-Azim);'' his bowing lasted
~~about the same length of time as his standing (and then on returning to
~~the standing posture after Ruku`) he said: "Allah listened to him who

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith mentions the Power and Majesty of Allah and
~~stresses that one should supplicate Allah for everything that one needs.
~~From guidance to sustenance, the treasures of everything are with Him -
~~the treasures which are unlimited and any withdrawal from them does not
~~make any reduction in them. Similar is the case of His Sovereignty; it
~~is not affected even if the whole universe supports or opposes them.
~~Thus, it is in the interest of man that he should dedicate himself
~~entirely to Allah and beg all his needs from Him and Him Alone.

# 3. After the age of sixty years, one must not neglect his religious

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith shows the excellence of Jihad and emancipation
~~of slaves. It also highlights the importance of co-operation and
~~sympathy with others. Similarly, one who refrains from putting others
~~into trouble, his reward for it is no less than that of propitiatory

~~is charity in every utterance of praise of Him; there is charity in

~~there is charity in enjoining good; there is charity in forbidding evil.
~~Two Rak`ah of Duha (Forenoon prayer) is equal to all this (in reward)".
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: There are three hundred and sixty joints in a human body.
~~It is these joints which enable him to work and make all kinds of
~~movements. If man's body did not have these joints it would have been
~~impossible for him to sit, stand, lie, move and make use of different

~~express gratitude to Allah. It is yet another Blessing of Allah that He
~~has also told man a very easy way of thanksgiving which can be practised
~~even by the poorest man in the world. This means of thanksgiving is
~~recitation of Tasbih (Subhan Allah), Tahmid (Al-hamdu lillah), Takbir
~~(Allahu Akbar), Tahlil (La ilaha illallah), and to preach virtue and
~~forbid wrong/ unlawful, etc. If one is unable to do even this, then he

~~give Sadaqah (charity) out of their surplus wealth.'' Upon this he (the
~~Prophet (PBUH)) said, "Has Allah not prescribed for you (a course)
~~following which you can (also) give Sadaqah? In every declaration of the

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith highlights two important points. Firstly, the
~~enthusiasm of the Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) for surpassing each

~~in Islam and it includes every action which is done with good intention,
~~provided it does not involve disobedience of Allah. So much so that it
~~covers even natural activities of man which fall in the category of
~~Mubah (that which is permissible and may be omitted without fear of sin)
~~and one is rewarded for them. Not only that, one is rewarded even for
~~abstaining from a sin on the condition that the abstention is for the
~~obedience of Allah. Then abstention rises to the level of an act of
~~obedience and is rewarded likewise.

# 126. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger

~~extremely thirsty. He found a well, he went down into it to drink water.
~~Upon leaving it, he saw a dog which was panting out of thirst. His
~~tongue was lolling out and he was eating moist earth from extreme

~~water, and holding it in his teeth, climbed up and quenched the thirst
~~of the dog. Allah appreciated his action and forgave his sins". The
~~Companions asked: "Shall we be rewarded for showing kindness to the
~~animals also?'' He (PBUH) said, "A reward is given in connection with
~~every living creature".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# In the narration of Al-Bukhari, the Prophet (PBUH) is reported to have
~~said: "Allah forgave him in appreciation of this act and admitted him to

# Commentary:
# 1. This Hadith emphasizes the importance of kindness to every
~~creature, even animals, because Allah is pleased with such kindness.

~~wants He may forgive a person even on a minor good action done by him.

~~himself) as a reward for cutting from the middle of the road, a tree
~~which was causing inconvenience to the Muslims".
# [Muslim].
# Another narration says: "A man who passed by a branch of a tree
~~leaning over a road and decided to remove it, saying to himself, `By
~~Allah! I will remove from the way of Muslims so that it would not harm

# Commentary: The act of saving people from harm and loss is greatly
~~liked by Allah, no matter how small it is. Allah is greatly pleased if a
~~person removes from the passage something that causes harm to people. On
~~the contrary, persons who restrict or obstruct passages and thereby
~~create inconvenience for the passers-by, as is usually done with great

# 128. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger

~~Jumu`ah prayer and listens (to the Khutbah) silently, the sins which he
~~has committed since the previous Friday plus three more days (i.e., 10
~~days) will be forgiven for him. One who distracts himself with pebbles
~~during the Khutbah will not get the (Jumu`ah) reward".
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith brings into prominence the following five
~~important points:
# 1. It induces one to take full care in ablutions, that is to say, it
~~should be strictly performed according to Sunnah.
# 2. The excellence of Jumu`ah (Friday prayer), which is obligatory for
~~every sane, adult, healthy and resident Muslim, whether he lives in a
~~town or village. The Friday prayer is performed in the mosque in
~~congregation. It has two Rak`ah at the time of noon prayer and is
~~preceded by Khutbah of Imam (who leads the prayer). It is not performed
~~individually at home.
# 3. Whoever does one good act will get ten-times reward in return.
~~According to this principle, one who performs a Friday prayer, his minor
~~sins relating the Rights of Allah which are committed by him in ten days
~~are forgiven.
# 4. Silence during the Khutbah is a must, otherwise, one loses the
~~reward of Jumu`ah prayer.
# 5. It is also necessary for a Khatib to deliver a brief Khutbah.

~~of Allah (PBUH) said, "When a Muslim or a believer washes his face (in
~~the course of Wudu'), every sin he has committed with his eyes is washed
~~away from his face along with water, or with the last drop of water;
~~when he washes his hands, every sin they wrought is erased from his

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith mentions the excellence of Wudu'. Obviously a

~~عليه وسلم قال : [ الصلوات الخمس والجمعة إلى الجمعة ورمضان إلى رمضان

~~Jumu`ah prayer to the (next) Jumu`ah prayer, and from Ramadan to Ramadan
~~are expiations for the (sins) committed in between (their intervals);
~~provided the major sins are not committed".
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: If a Muslim saves himself from major sins and does not
~~neglect his obligations to people, then he remains free from sins by
~~means of the `Ibadah (worship) stated above.

### ||| AUTO 131 - الخامس عشر عنه رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى
~~الله عليه وسلم : [ ألا أدلكم على ما يمحو الله به الخطايا ويرفع به

~~وكثرة الخطا إلى المساجد وانتظار الصلاة بعد الصلاة فذلكم الرباط ] رواه مسلم
# 131. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) said, "Should I not direct you to something by which
~~Allah obliterates the sins and elevates (your) ranks.'' They said: "Yes,
~~O Messenger of Allah". He said, "Performing Wudu' properly, even in
~~difficulty, frequently going to the mosque, and waiting eagerly for the
~~next Salat (prayer) after a Salat is over; indeed, that is Ar-Ribat".
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: Ribat means staying on the frontier of an Islamic country,
~~for security and defense purposes. Thus, it is a continuous process of
~~Jihad. Continuous good deeds and `Ibadah have been compared with Ribat.
~~Performing full ablution in Makarih (where severe unpleasantness and
~~hard labour is involved) is quite difficult. For instance, in winter it
~~is very cumbersome to properly wash all the organs of the body but a
~~Muslim does it to please Allah. Thus, its reward will be more in
~~proportion to the labour. Similarly, the nearness of a mosque is in many
~~respect very useful but its being far from the house is better in this
~~respect that the greater distance one has to cover for going to the
~~mosque, the higher the reward for going there will be. Those who live
~~close to the mosque do not have this credit.

~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "He who observes the Fajr and `Asr
~~(prayers) will enter Jannah.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: Muslims are enjoined to take special care of two of the
~~five prescribed Salat, namely Fajr and `Asr because they occur during
~~very comfortable hours. Their excellence, and inducement on them, have
~~been mentioned here for the reason that there is greater possibility of
~~laziness and negligence in these two Salat. It is very difficult indeed
~~to rise for Salat-ul-Fajr (the dawn prayer). Similar is the case of
~~Salat-ul-`Asr (the afternoon prayer). It is the time when a person is
~~very busy in winding up his daily affairs and thus there is serious risk
~~of losing this Salat on this account. One who observes these two at
~~their stated time, can easily secure the other three without much
~~effort. This endeavour on his part to secure Salat will be a very
~~effective means for him to enter Jannah.

# 150. `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them)
~~reported: The Prophet (PBUH) was informed that I said that I would
~~perform prayers the whole night and observe fasting every day as long as
~~I live. Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Is it you who said this?'' I
~~said to him, "O Messenger of Allah! I ransom you with my parents, it is
~~I who said that.'' Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "You will not be able
~~to do that. Observe fast and break it; sleep and get up for prayer, and
~~observe fast for three days during the month; for every good is
~~multiplied ten times and that will be equal to fasting the whole year.''
~~I said, "O Messenger of Allah! I can do more than that.'' He said,
~~"Observe fast one day and leave off the next two days.'' I said, "O
~~Messenger of Allah! I have strength to do more than that.'' Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) said, "Observe fast every other day, and that is the
~~fasting of Dawud (PBUH) and that is the most moderate fasting".
# According to another narration: Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "That
~~is the best fasting.'' I said, "But I am capable of doing more than
~~this". Thereupon, Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "There is nothing
~~better than this.'' `Abdullah bin `Amr (May Allah be pleased with them)
~~said (when he grew old): "Had I accepted the three days (fasting during
~~every month) as the Messenger of Allah had said, it would have been
~~dearer to me than my family and my property".
# In another narration `Abdullah is reported to have said: Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) said to me, "O `Abdullah! Have I not been informed that you
~~observe fast during the day and offer prayer all the night.'' I replied,
~~"Yes, O Messenger of Allah!'' Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Don't do
~~that. Observe fast for few days and then leave off for few days, perform
~~prayers and also sleep at night, as your body has a right upon you, and
~~your eyes have a right upon you; and your wife has a right upon you;
~~your visitors have a right upon you. It is sufficient for you to observe
~~fast three days in a month, as the reward of good deeds is multiplied
~~ten times, so it will be like fasting the whole year.'' I insisted (on
~~fasting) and so I was given a hard instruction. I said, "O Messenger of
~~Allah! I have strength.'' Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Observe fast
~~like the fasting of Prophet Dawud (PBUH); and do not fast more than
~~that.'' I said: "How was the fasting of Prophet Dawud?'' He (PBUH) said,
~~"Half of the year (i.e., he used to fast on every alternate day).''
# Afterwards when `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with him) grew old, he
~~used to say: "Would that I had availed myself of the concession granted
~~to me by Messenger of Allah.''
# In another narration `Abdullah is reported to have said: Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) said, "I have been informed that you observe fast
~~continuously and recite (the whole of the Qur'an) every night.'' I said,
~~"Messenger of Allah! It is right, but I covet thereby nothing but
~~good,'' whereupon he (PBUH) said, "Then observe fasts like the fasting
~~of Prophet Dawud (PBUH) as he was the most ardent worshipper of Allah;
~~recite the Qur'an once every month.'' I said, "O Prophet of Allah! I am
~~capable of doing more than that.'' He said, "Then recite it (the
~~complete Qur'an) in every twenty days.'' I said, "O Prophet of Allah I
~~am capable of reciting more than that.'' He said, "Then recite it once
~~in every ten days.'' I said, "O Prophet of Allah! I am capable of
~~reciting more than that.'' He said, "Then recite it once in every seven
~~days, but not recite more than that.'' The Prophet of Allah also said to
~~me, "You do not know, you may have a longer life". When I grew old I
~~wished I had availed myself of the concession (granted to me by) the
~~Prophet of Allah.
# In another narration `Abdullah is reported to have said: Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) said, "The best fasting with Allah is that of (Prophet)
~~Dawud, and the best prayer with Allah is that of Dawud (PBUH) for he
~~would sleep half of the night and stand for prayer for the third of it
~~and (then) would sleep sixth part of it; he observed fast one day and
~~leave off the other. He would not flee on meeting the enemy".
# In another narration `Abdullah is reported to have said: My father
~~helped me marry a noble woman and he used to inquire of his daughter-in-
~~law regarding her husband. She would say: "He is, indeed, a fine man.
~~Since I have come to him, he has neither stepped on my bed nor he has
~~had sexual intercourse with me". When this state of affairs lasted for
~~some time, my father mentioned the matter to Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
~~who directed my father saying, "Send him to me". I went to him
~~accordingly. He asked me, "How often do you observe fast?'' I replied;
~~"Daily". He asked me, "How long do you take in reading the Noble Qur'an
~~completely.'' I said, "Once every night". Then he narrated the whole
~~story. He (in his old age) would recite one seventh of his nightly
~~recitation to some members of his family during the day to lighten his
~~task at night. Whenever he wished to have a relief from his fast on
~~alternate days, he would give up fasting for a few days and make up
~~deficiency later by observing the number of fasts he had missed. He
~~would not give up the number of fasts altogether because he did not like
~~to abandon what he had settled with Messenger of Allah (PBUH).
# Commentary: This Hadith brings the following two things into focus:
# 1. Besides mentioning the continence and ardour for worship of the
~~Companions of the Prophet (PBUH), it tells us of the teachings of the
~~Prophet of Allah to adopt moderation and fulfill the lawful needs of
~~life as well as religion.
# 2. It also presents a model of the chastity, modesty and bashfulness
~~of the Sahabiyat (women who embraced Islam and saw the Prophet (PBUH)).
~~It tells how patiently they bore the indifference of their husbands. In
~~the instance quoted in the above mentioned Hadith, the politeness with
~~which the wife of Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased
~~with them) answered her father-in-law when he inquired her about the
~~treatment of her husband is a model of decency and modesty.

~~and Jannah, we feel as if we are seeing them with our very eyes, and
~~when we are away from Messenger of Allah (PBUH), we attend to our wives,

~~(May Allah be pleased with him) and I went to Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
~~and I said to him, "O Messenger of Allah (PBUH), Hanzalah has turned

~~company, and are reminded of Hell-fire and Jannah, we feel as if we are
~~seeing them with our own eyes, but when we go away from you and attend
~~to our wives, children and business, much of these things go out of our
~~minds.'' Thereupon Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "By Him in Whose Hand
~~is my life if your state of mind remains the same as it is in my
~~presence and you are always busy in remembrance (of Allah), the angels
~~will shake hands with you in your beds and in your roads; but Hanzalah,

~~of the Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) with reference to the natural
~~instinct of man to think differently in different situations. This

# 162. Abu Musa (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) said, "The similitude of guidance and knowledge with which
~~Allah has sent me is like a rain which has fallen on some ground. A
~~fertile part of earth has absorbed water and brought forth much grass
~~and herbs. Another part, which is solid, held the water and Allah
~~benefits men thereby, who drank and gave others to drink, and used it
~~for irrigation. But some of it has fallen on a portion of sandy land
~~which neither retains the water nor produces herbage. Such is the
~~likeness of the man who understands the religion of Allah and who gets

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: In this Hadith the guidance and knowledge which was sent
~~to mankind through the Prophet (PBUH) is compared to the rain which is
~~beneficial, because this knowledge resuscitates the dead hearts as does
~~the rain to a barren land. One who makes use of this knowledge is
~~likened to a good soil, and one who acquires this knowledge and imparts
~~it to others but does not put it into practice is considered akin to a
~~hard land which holds water and other people utilize it. A person who
~~neither learns it nor acts upon it is like a desolate land which neither
~~holds water nor produces anything. Such a person is the worst of all
~~because he neither himself benefits from it nor lets others make use of

~~(Black Stone of the Ka`bah) is not kissed for because stones are

# 168. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When it
~~was revealed to Messenger of Allah (PBUH): "To Allah belongs all that is
~~in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and whether you disclose
~~what is in your own selves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account
~~for it,'' the Companions of Messenger of Allah (PBUH) felt it hard and
~~severe and they came to Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and sat down on their
~~knees and said: "O Messenger of Allah, we were assigned some duties
~~which were within our power to perform, such as Salat (prayer), Saum
~~(fasting), Jihad (striving in the Cause of Allah), Sadaqah (charity).
~~Then this (the above mentioned) Verse was revealed to you and it is
~~beyond our power to live up to it.'' Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Do
~~you want to say what the people of two Books (Jews and Christians) said
~~before you: 'We hear and disobey?' You should rather say: 'We hear and
~~we obey, we seek forgiveness, our Rubb and unto You is the return.'''
~~And they said: "We hear and we obey, (we seek) Your forgiveness, our
~~Rubb! And unto You is the return.'' When the people recited it and it
~~smoothly flowed on their tongues, then Allah revealed immediately
~~afterwards: "The Messenger (Muhammad (PBUH)) believes in what has been
~~sent down to him from his Rubb, and (so do) the believers. Each one
~~believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They
~~say), 'We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers' -
~~and they say, 'We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your forgiveness, our
~~Rubb, and to You is the return (of all)". When they did that, Allah
~~abrogated this (Ayah) and Allah the Great revealed: "Allah burdens not a
~~person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has
~~earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned.'' (The
~~Prophet (PBUH) said): "Yes. 'Our Rubb! Lay not on us a burden like that
~~which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians)". (The
~~Prophet (PBUH) said): "Yes. 'Our Rubb! Put not on us a burden greater
~~than we have strength to bear". (The Prophet (PBUH) said): "Yes. 'Pardon

~~(Patron, Supporter and Protector) and give us victory over the
~~disbelieving people".
# He (the Prophet (PBUH)) said: "Yes".

# Commentary: We learn from this Hadith that initially every person was
~~answerable for thoughts and doubts even those which crossed his mind;
~~something on which nobody had any control. The Companions of the Prophet
~~(PBUH) were naturally disturbed on this situation. But when they heard
~~and obeyed the orders of the Prophet (PBUH) then Almighty Allah revoked
~~this order with the elaboration that He does not put anyone to trouble

# 169. `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) said, "If anyone introduces in our matter something which
~~does not belong to it, will be rejected".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# The narration in Muslim says: "If anybody introduces a practice which
~~is not authenticated by me, it is to be rejected".
# Commentary: This Hadith lays down a very important principle.
~~Unfortunately, Muslims have not attached any importance to this Hadith
~~and the principle given in it with the result that innovations in the
~~Deen have become so common that they have been taken for true Deen; our
~~people act upon them and are made to practice them. One reason for this
~~is their lack of education and ignorance about Deen. The second reason
~~is their lack of understanding of the principle prescribed in this
~~Hadith although it is stated in very explicit terms.
# The principle that we learn from this Hadith is that every such action
~~or activity is innovation which is done as a virtue and to gain the
~~Pleasure of Allah but is not consonant with the teachings of the Qur'an
~~and Sunnah, or which does not agree with the interpretation of the Nuss
~~(text) given by the Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) or their successors
~~(Tabi`un). The reason being that the period of the Companions and the
~~Tabi`un is the Khair-ul-Qurun (the best of all generations). Thus any
~~action or activity that is deprived of the support of these generations
~~falls in the category of heresies.

# 171. Jarir bin `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: We
~~were with Messenger of Allah (PBUH) shortly after dawn when there came
~~to him some people clad in woollen rags, or covered with sleeveless
~~blankets; and with swords hanging down from their necks. Most of them
~~rather, all of them, belonged to the Mudar tribe. The face of the
~~Prophet (PBUH) changed when he saw them starving. Then he went into his
~~house and came out; then he commanded Bilal (May Allah be pleased with
~~him) to proclaim Adhan (call to prayers). So he proclaimed Adhan and
~~recited Iqamah and the Prophet (PBUH) led the Salat. Then he delivered a
~~Khutbah saying, "O mankind! Be dutiful to your Rubb, Who created you
~~from a single person (Adam), and from him (Adam) He created his wife
~~(Eve), and from them both He created many men and women; and fear Allah
~~through Whom you demand your (natural) rights, and do not sever the
~~relations of kinship. Surely, Allah is Ever an All-Watcher over you.''
~~(4:1) He also recited the Ayah which is in the end of Surat Al-Hashr: "O
~~you who believe! Fear Allah and keep your duty to Him. And let every one
~~look what he has sent forth for the tomorrow". (59:18). Thereafter,
~~every man gave in charity Dinar, Dirham, clothes, measure-fulls of wheat
~~and measure-fulls of dates till he said: "(Give in charity) be it half a
~~date". Then a man of the Ansar came with a bag which was difficult for
~~him to hold in his hand. Thereafter, the people came successively (with
~~charity) till I saw two heaps of food and clothes. I noticed that the
~~face of Messenger of Allah (PBUH) was glowing like that of the bright
~~moon or glittering gold. Then he (PBUH) said, "Whosoever introduces a
~~good practice in Islam, there is for him its reward and the reward of
~~those who act upon it after him without anything being diminished from
~~their rewards. And whosoever introduces an evil practice in Islam, will
~~shoulder its sin and the sins of all those who will act upon it, without
~~diminishing in any way their burden"
# [Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. Some people try to deduce a proof for good innovations from the
~~words: "Mun sana' fi Al- islam sunah hasanah". Whosoever introduces a
~~good practice in Islam.
# Thus they classify innovations Bid`ah into two categories, namely good
~~innovations and bad innovations. But this is wrong. No innovation can be
~~good. It is always bad because it amounts to inventing Shar`iah which no
~~one has the right to do. Constitution of Shar`iah is the exclusive Right
~~of Allah Alone. It is He who constitutes the Shar`iah and it is on His
~~behest that His Prophets convey it to the people. Not to speak of
~~scholars and others.
# 2. What this Hadith makes abundantly clear is that anyone who tries to
~~find new ways and means to preach and practice Islamic Shar`iah, which
~~are later on adopted by other people also, would not only get the reward
~~of doing so but he will also be rewarded for the endeavours of those who
~~will after him continue them and perform good deeds. But anything of
~~which we do not find any trace in Shar`iah is bad. It cannot be good in
~~any case, no matter what means are adopted for this purpose.
# 3. Other benefits of this Hadith are self-evident and do not need
~~further elaboration.

~~قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ من جهز غازيا في سبيل الله فقد
~~غزا ومن خلف غازيا في أهله بخير فقد غزا ] متفق عليه
# 177. Khalid Al-Juhani (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The
~~Prophet (PBUH) said, "He who equips a warrior in the way of Allah (will
~~get the reward of the one who has actually gone for Jihad); and he who
~~looks after the family of a warrior in the way of Allah will get the
~~reward of the one who has gone for Jihad".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith tells the mode which can make Jihad more
~~effective and give the participants of Jihad equal share in its reward.
~~Every society has many able-bodied young people who want to take part in
~~Jihad but do not have the resources for it, and this is how a very
~~useful segment of the society fails to make any contribution to it. On
~~the other hand, there are people in the society who have plenty of
~~resources but do not possess health, vigour and youth which are
~~essential for Jihad. According to the method prescribed in this Hadith,
~~not only the requisite manpower and resources essential for Jihad are
~~combined but everyone gets an even share in its reward. It should be
~~kept in mind that in the early period of Islam, Mujahidun (the Muslims
~~who took part in Jihad) were neither professional soldiers nor were they
~~paid regular salaries, the way they now constitute a regular, permanent
~~and vast military institution. These Mujahidun used to take part in
~~Jihad voluntarily as is being done nowadays under many organizations also.

# 196. `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah bepleased with him) reported:
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "The first defect (in religion) which
~~affected the Children of Israel in the way that man would meet another
~~and say to him: `Fear Allah and abstain from what you are doing, for
~~this is not lawful for you.' Then he would meet him the next day and
~~find no change in him, but this would not prevent him from eating with
~~him, drinking with him and sitting in his assemblies. When it came to
~~this, Allah led their hearts into evil ways on account of their
~~association with others.'' Then he (PBUH) recited, "Those among the
~~Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of Dawud
~~(David) and `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). That was because they
~~disobeyed (Allah and the Messengers) and were ever transgressing beyond
~~bounds. They used not to forbid one another from the Munkar (wrong,
~~evildoing, sins, polytheism, disbelief) which they committed. Vile
~~indeed was what they used to do. You see many of them taking the
~~disbelievers as their Auliya' (protectors and helpers). Evil indeed is
~~that which their own selves have sent forward before them; for that
~~(reason) Allah's wrath fell upon them and in torment will they abide.
~~And had they believed in Allah and in the Prophet (Muhammad (PBUH)) and
~~in what has been revealed to him, never would they have taken them (the
~~disbelievers) as Auliya' (protectors and helpers); but many of them are
~~the Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).'' (5:78-81)
# Then he (PBUH) continued: "Nay, by Allah, you either enjoin good and
~~forbid evil and catch hold of the hand of the oppressor and persuade him
~~to act justly and stick to the truth, or, Allah will involve the hearts
~~of some of you with the hearts of others and will curse you as He had
~~cursed them".
# [Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].
# The wording in At-Tirmidhi is: Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "When
~~the Children of Israel became sinful, their learned men prohibited them
~~but they would not turn back. Yet, the learned men associated with them
~~and ate and drank with them. So, they were cursed at the tongues of
~~Dawud and `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), because they were
~~disobedient and were given to transgression.'' At this stage Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) who was reclining on a pillow sat up and said, "No, By
~~Him in Whose Hand my soul is, there is no escape for you but you
~~persuade them to act justly.''
# Commentary: This Hadith tells us that the duty of `Ulama' is to check
~~the people from vice and if, in spite of all their efforts people do not
~~abandon them, they should avoid associating with them because it is a
~~matter of religious reverence and vanity. If they do not do it, they
~~will also be cursed like the disobedient lot. May Allah save us from
~~this negligence.

~~أيها الناس إنكم لتقرؤون هذه الآية : { يا أيها الذين آمنوا عليكم أنفسكم
~~لا يضركم من ضل إذا اهتديتم } ( المائدة 105 ) وإني سمعت رسول الله ms063 صلى
~~الله عليه وسلم يقول : [ إن الناس إذا رأوا الظالم فلم يأخذوا على يديه
~~أوشك أن يعمهم الله بعقاب منه ] رواه أبو داود والترمذي والنسائي بأسانيد صحيحة
# 197. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: "O
~~you people! You recite this Verse: `O you who believe! Take care of your
~~ownselves. If you follow the (right) guidance [and enjoin what is right
~~(Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbid what
~~is wrong (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden)] no
~~hurt can come to you from those who are in error.' (5:105) But I have
~~heard Messenger of Allah (PBUH) saying: "When people see an oppressor
~~but do not prevent him from (doing evil), it is likely that Allah will
~~punish them all.''
# [Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: What Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (May Allah bepleased with him) had
~~stated was that the Ayah mentioned in this Hadith was generally
~~understood to mean that if a person is on the Straight Path then it is
~~not necessary for him to preach virtue and forbid vice because in that
~~case he neither has the fear of being harmed by the disobedience and
~~sins of others nor is he answerable to Allah for their misdeeds. Thus,
~~what it implies is that Muslim Ummah is not responsible for the
~~enforcement of Islamic Shari`ah in the world and all it is concerned
~~with is its own improvement only. By narrating this Hadith, Abu Bakr As-
~~Siddiq (May Allah bepleased with him) refuted this interpretation of the
~~Ayah and made it clear that it is the duty of the Ummah and each of its
~~member to make best possible efforts to check the vices prevalent in the
~~society. So much so that if a Muslim has the ability to check the vices
~~by means of force or speech but he does not do it, his negligence in
~~this regard will become a cause of Divine wrath and punishment. The true
~~significance of this ayah is that if, in spite of the best efforts on
~~the part of the pious ones there is no improvement, and people do not
~~abstain from sins and disobedience of Allah, then the pious persons will
~~not be held responsible for what the defaulters do, nor would they
~~suffer on this account. This interpretation of the ¢yah removes the
~~conflict that seems to exist between the meaning of the Ayah and the Hadith

# 200. Hudhaifah bin Al-Yaman (May Allah bepleased with him) reported:
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) foretold to us two Ahadith. I have seen one
~~(being fulfilled), and I am waiting for the other. He (PBUH) told us,
~~"Amanah (the trust) descended in the innermost (root) of the hearts of
~~men (that is, it was in their heart innately, by Fitrah, or pure human
~~nature). Then the Qur'an was revealed and they learnt from the Quran and
~~they learned from the Sunnah.'' Then the (Prophet (PBUH)) told us about
~~the removal of Amanah. He said, "The man would have some sleep, and
~~Amanah would be taken away from his heart leaving the impression of a
~~faint mark. He would again sleep, and Amanah would be taken away from
~~his heart leaving an impression of a blister, as if you rolled down an
~~ember on your foot and it was vesicled. He would see a swelling having
~~nothing in it.'' He (the Prophet (PBUH)) then took up a pebble and
~~rolled it over his foot and said, "The people would enter into
~~transactions with one another and hardly a person would be left who
~~would return (things) entrusted to him (and there would look like an
~~honest person) till it would be said: `In such and such tribe there is a
~~trustworthy man.' And they would also say about a person: `How prudent
~~he is! How handsome he is and how intelligent he is!' whereas in his
~~heart there would be no grain of Faith.'' Hudhaifah bin Al-Yaman (May
~~Allah bepleased with him) added: I had a time when I did not care with
~~whom amongst you I did business, I entered into a transaction, for if he
~~were a Muslim, his Faith would compel him to discharge his obligation to
~~me; and if he were a Christian or a Jew, his guardian (surety) would
~~compel him to discharge his obligation to me. But today I would not
~~enter into a transaction except with so-and-so.
# [Al-Bukh ri and Muslim].
# Commentary: The word `Amanah' (trust) is a very comprehensive term
~~which includes everything like adherence to Islamic injunctions,
~~fairness in dealing, giving everybody his due, etc. According to this
~~Hadith, with decline in moral values the true sense of Amanah will
~~gradually go on diminishing and eventually a stage will come which has
~~been elucidated in the text of this Hadith.

~~202. Abu Khubaib `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair (May Allah bepleased with them)
~~reported: When Az-Zubair, got ready to fight in the battle of Al-Jamal,
~~he called me and said: "My son, whoever is killed today will be either a
~~wrongdoer or a wronged one. I expect that I shall be the the wronged one
~~today. I am much worried about my debt. Do you think that anything will
~~be left over from our property after the payment of my debt? My son,
~~sell our property and pay off my debt.'' Az-Zubair then willed one-third
~~of that portion to his sons; namely `Abdullah's sons. He said, "One-
~~third of the one-third. If any property is left after the payment of
~~debts, one-third (of the one-third of what is left is to be given to
~~your sons.'' (Hisham, a subnarrator added: "Some of the sons of
~~`Abdullah were equal in age to the sons of Az-Zubair, e.g., Khubaib and
~~Abbad. `Abdullah had nine sons and nine daughters at that time)". (The
~~narrator `Abdullah added:) He kept on instructing me about his debts and
~~then said: "My son, should you find yourself unable to pay any portion
~~of my debt then beseech my Master for His help.'' By Allah, I did not
~~understand what he meant and asked: "Father, who is your Master?'' He
~~said: "Allah.'' By Allah! Whenever I faced a difficulty in discharging
~~any portion of his debt; I would pray: "O Master of Zubair, discharge
~~his debt,'' and He discharged it. Zubair was martyred. He left no money,
~~but he left certain lands, one of them in Al-Ghabah, eleven houses in
~~Al-Madinah, two in Basrah, one in Kufah and one in Egypt. The cause of
~~his indebtedness was that a person would come to him asking him to keep
~~some money of his in trust for him. Zubair would refuse to accept it as
~~a trust, fearing it might be lost, but would take it as a loan. He never
~~accepted a governorship, or revenue office, or any public office. He
~~fought along with Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and Abu Bakr, `Umar and
~~`Uthman (May Allah be pleased with them).
# `Abdullah added: I prepared a statement of his debts and they amounted
~~to two million and two hundred thousand! Hakim bin Hizam met me and
~~asked me: "Nephew, how much is due from my brother as debt?'' I kept it
~~as secret and said: "A hundred thousand.'' Hakim said: "By Allah! I do
~~not think your assets are sufficient for the payment of these debts.'' I
~~said: "What would you think if the amount were two million and two
~~hundred thousand?'' He said: "I do not think that you would be able to
~~clear off the debts. If you find it difficult let me know.''
# Az-Zubair (May Allah bepleased with him) had purchased the land in Al-
~~Ghabah for a hundred and seventy thousand. `Abdullah sold it for a
~~million and six hundred thousand, and declared that whosoever had a
~~claim against Az-Zubair (May Allah bepleased with him) should see him in
~~Al-Ghabah. `Abdullah bin Ja`far (May Allah bepleased with him) came to
~~him and said: "Az-Zubair (May Allah bepleased with him) owed me four
~~hundred thousand, but I would remit the debt if you wish.'' `Abdullah
~~(May Allah bepleased with him) said: "No.'' Ibn Ja`far said: ``If you
~~would desire for postponement I would postpone the recovery of it.''
~~`Abdullah said: "No.'' Ibn Ja`far then said: "In that case, measure out
~~a plot for me.'' `Abdullah marked out a plot. Thus he sold the land and
~~discharged his father's debt. There remained out of the land four and a
~~half shares. He then visited Mu`awiyah who had with him at the time `Amr

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: The Hadith shows that a true Muslim is one who does not do

~~of twelve months of which four are inviolable; three of them consecutive
~~- Dhul-Qa`dah, Dhul-Hijjah and Muharram and Rajab, the month of Mudar

~~We said, "Allah and His Messenger (PBUH) know better". The Prophet
~~(PBUH) remained silent for some time until we thought that he would give
~~it a name other than its real name. Then asked, "Is it not (the month

~~is this?". We replied: "Allah and His Messenger know better". He
~~remained silent until we thought that he would give it another name. He
~~(PBUH) asked, "Is it not Al-Baldah (Makkah)?'' We said: "Yes". He (PBUH)
~~asked, "What day is this?". We said: "Allah and His Messenger know
~~better.'' He (PBUH) remained silent until we thought that he would give
~~it another name. He asked, "Is it not the day of An-Nahr (the
~~sacrifice)?". We replied in the affirmative. Thereupon he said, "Your
~~blood, your property and your honour are inviolable to you all like the
~~inviolablity of this day of yours, in this city of yours and in this
~~month of yours. You will soon meet your Rubb and He will ask you about
~~your deeds. So do not turn to disbelief after me by striking the necks
~~of one another. Behold! Let him who is present here convey (this message
~~) to him who is absent; for many a person to whom a message is conveyed
~~has more retentive memory than the one who hears it.'' He (PBUH) again
~~said, "Have I conveyed the message to you? Behold! Have I conveyed the
~~Commandments (of Allah) to you.'' We submitted: "Yes". He then said, "O
~~Allah, bear witness (to this)".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. The cycle of years and months (that is to say a month consists of
~~30 or 29 days and a year has 12 months) was completed at the time of
~~creation of heavens and earth.
# 2. The Hadith mentions the sanctity of life, property, respect and

# 3. It reminds that everyone will be answerable for his actions on the
~~Day of Requittal.
# 4. It urges that one should not just keep to oneself the Commandments

# 219. Umm Salamah (May Allah bepleased with her) reported: Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) said, "Verily, I am only a human and the claimants bring to
~~me (their disputes); perhaps some of them are more eloquent than others.
~~I judge according to what I hear from them). So, he whom I, by my
~~judgment, (give the undue share) out of the right of a Muslim, I in fact
~~give him a portion of (Hell) Fire".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. The Prophet (PBUH) has explained through this Hadith that he, too,
~~was a man like others and was thus liable to judging by what he hears by
~~the facile tongue, cleverness and eloquence of people. But it does not
~~detract from his innocence as a Prophet because it has no concern with
~~his duty as a preacher and Prophet, the responsibility of protection of
~~which has been accepted by Allah.
# 2. A judge (Qadi) should decide on the case which comes before him in
~~the light of arguments presented to him by the litigants. He should not
~~make decision according to speculation but go by the arguments which are
~~in his opinion more convincing.
# 3. The decision of the Qadi will be evidently enforced, but it will
~~not make the lawful as unlawful or vice versa. That is to say, it will
~~not be enforced intrinsically, as is believed by some people. If
~~somebody succeeds in winning a case, it will be invalid and the one who
~~secures it will suffer its consequences in the Hell-fire.

# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: This Hadith has two meanings. Firstly, so long as a Muslim

~~Grace of Allah, capable of acting upon the Deen. That is to say, he is
~~more hopeful of the Mercy of Allah, and deserves it also, as long as he

# Commentary: In this Hadith, brevity of prayers stands for recitation

~~The Sahih Muslim has elucidated this by saying that the Prophet (PBUH)

# This Hadith also prohibits Muslims from mutual hatred, enmity and

~~has covered it up but in the morning he tears up the cover provided by
~~Allah Himself.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: We learn from this Hadith that commission of a sin due to
~~human frailties on which one is ashamed but does not like to express is
~~something which might hopefully be forgiven by Allah. In fact, its
~~remission after penitence is almost sure. But to commit a sin openly is
~~totally different because, firstly, the heart of such a person is
~~deprived of the fear of Allah. Secondly, he has no respect and regard
~~for Divine injunctions. Thirdly, such a person usually does not repent
~~his sins. Fourthly, he makes a declaration of breach of Divine
~~injunctions which amounts to inviting His wrath and punishment.

~~girl. The order that one should not censure and reproach her is perhaps

# Commentary: To imprecate a Muslim virtually amounts to helping Satan
~~against him, because the latter is avowed to mislead people and to
~~expose man to humiliation in this world and the Hereafter. Such people

~~from this Hadith. They hold that its punishment is discretionary which
~~can be increased or decreased according to the circumstances. But other
~~learned men who hold that its Hadd is forty stripes argue that the
~~incident quoted in this Hadith relates to the period when its Hadd had
~~not been fixed. When the Prophet (PBUH) ordered the punishment of forty
~~stripes for it then it became its prescribed Hadd. Abu Bakr (May Allah
~~bepleased with him) followed it during the period of his caliphate.
~~`Umar (May Allah bepleased with him) also applied it in the early years
~~of his caliphate but subsequently raised its punishment to eighty
~~stripes. The `Ulama' who maintain the punishment of forty stripes
~~contend that the original Hadd was forty stripes and the additional
~~forty stripes comprised discretionary punishment for which the Head of a
~~state has full authority. If he feels, he can add discretionary
~~punishment to the Hadd. The nature of this additional punishment depends
~~on his discretion. The latter opinion seems to be more correct that Hadd
~~is fixed for drinking and its punishment is not based on discretion. The
~~Hadd for it is forty stripes but this Hadd can be increased by adding
~~discretionary punishment to it. Allah knows best.

~~about peace between them and he was detained. The time for Salat
~~approached and Bilal (May Allah be pleased with them) went to Abu Bakr
~~(May Allah be pleased with him) and said to him: "Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) has got late and it is the time for Salat. Will you lead Salat?''

~~proclaimed the Adhan and then pronounced Iqamah. Abu Bakr (May Allah be

~~Takbir and the people followed him). In the meantime, Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) arrived and, passing through the rows, took his stand in the
~~first row. The people started clapping. It was the habit of Abu Bakr
~~(May Allah be pleased with him) that whenever he started praying, he
~~would never look round. He paid no heed (to the clapping). When the
~~clapping increased, he turned round and saw Messenger of Allah (PBUH).
~~He (the Prophet (PBUH)) beckoned him to continue performing Salat. But
~~Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) raised his hands and praised
~~Allah. Then he retreated, taking his steps backwards. When Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) saw that, he went ahead and led Salat. When he finished
~~Salat, he faced the congregation and said, "Why do you clap when
~~something happens during the Salat. Clapping is only for women. If
~~something happens in the course of Salat you should say, Subhan Allah.
~~It is bound to attract attention. And you, Abu Bakr, what prevented you

~~families, they lived in Quba. A quarrel arose among them on some issue
~~and they used stones and brickbats against each other. When the Prophet

~~who are estranged from each other so that tension among them is not
~~aggravated. If efforts are not made for reconciliation at the initial
~~stages, the conflict will be escalated and then it will become difficult
~~to resolve it.
# 2. Salat can be offered behind two Imam, one after the other.
# 3. In the course of Salat if Imam makes an error, his followers should
~~bring it to his attentions by saying the words "Subhan Allah'' aloud.

~~259. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet
~~(PBUH) said, "None spoke in the cradle but only three (persons), Isa
~~(Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary), the second one was the companion of Juraij
~~who was a pious person. Juraij took a secluded monastery for worship and
~~confined himself in it. His mother came to him as he was busy in prayer
~~and she called: `Juraij.' He said: `My Rubb, my mother (is calling me
~~while I am engaged in) my prayer.' He continued with the prayer. She
~~returned and she came on the next day and he was (still) busy in prayer.
~~She called: `Juraij.' And he said: `My Rubb, my mother (is calling me
~~while I am engaged) in prayer, and he continued with the prayer,' and
~~she returned. Then on the next day she again came while he was busy in
~~prayer and called: `Juraij.' And he said: `My Rubb, my mother (is
~~calling me while I am engaged) in my prayer.' And he continued with the
~~prayer. She said: `My Rubb, don't let him die until he has seen the
~~faces of the prostitutes.' The story of Juraij and that of his
~~meditation and prayer spread amongst Banu Israel. There was a prostitute
~~who had been a beauty personified. She said (to the people): `If you
~~like, I can lure him to evil.' She presented herself to him but he paid
~~no heed (to her). She came to a shepherd who lived near the temple and
~~she offered herself to him. He (the shepherd) had sexual intercourse
~~with her and so she became pregnant. When she gave birth to a baby she
~~said: `This is from Juraij.' So they came and asked Juraij to get down
~~and demolished the temple and began to beat him. He asked them what the
~~matter was. They said: `You have committed fornication with this
~~prostitute and she has given birth to a baby from you.' He said: `Where
~~is the baby?' They brought him (the baby) and then he said: `Just leave
~~me so that I should perform prayer.' He performed prayer and when he
~~finished, he lifted the baby in his stomach and asked him: `O boy, who
~~is your father?' The baby answered: `He is such and such a shepherd.'
~~So, the people turned towards Juraij, kissed him and touched him (for
~~seeking blessing) and said: `We are prepared to construct your temple
~~with gold.' He said, `No just, rebuild it with mud as it had been,' and
~~so they did". (The Prophet (PBUH) continued:) "Then there was a baby who
~~was sucking at his mother's breast when a person dressed in fine garment
~~came on a priceless riding animal's back. His mother said: `O Allah,
~~make my child like this one.' He (the babe) left sucking and looked at
~~him, and said: `O Allah, don't make me like him.' He then returned to
~~the breast and resumed sucking.'' He (Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased
~~with him) said: As though I can see Messenger of Allah (PBUH) as he is
~~illustrating the scene of his sucking milk with his forefinger in his
~~mouth and sucking that. He (Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with
~~him)) further reported Messenger of Allah (PBUH) as saying, "There
~~happened to pass by them a slave girl who was being beaten and they were
~~saying: `You have committed fornication and theft.' She was saying:
~~`Allah is enough for me and He is my Good Protector, and his mother
~~said: `O Allah, don't make my child like her.' He left sucking looked at
~~her and said: `O Allah! Make me like her.' It was followed by a
~~conversation between the mother and the child. She said: `A good looking
~~man happened to pass by and I said: O Allah, make my child like him, and
~~you said: O Allah, don't make me like him, and there passed a girl while
~~they were beating her and saying: You committed fornication and theft,
~~and I said: O Allah, don't make my child like her, and you said: O
~~Allah, make me like her.' The child said: `That man was a tyrant, and I
~~said: O Allah don't make me like him; and they were saying about the
~~girl: You committed fornication, whereas in fact she had not committed
~~that and they were saying: You have committed theft, whereas she had not
~~committed theft, so I said: O Allah, make me like her".

# Commentary: Our rich class has made Walimah (marriage banquet given by
~~the bridegroom) a highly luxurious affair and a means of displaying
~~wealth and richness. This excessive exaggeration of a simple feast has
~~brought in its wake many religious, moral and social evils. In its
~~present form, it is sheer extravagance and wastage which are satanic
~~acts and those who do it are brothers of Satan. It is such a big loss
~~and serious threat that if our rich class is left with any sense of
~~religion, it should immediately abandon this extravagance which is
~~escalating day by day. Its moral disadvantage is that one invites in
~~this function only men of his own status and not the the poor, whereas
~~the fact is that it is the latter who deserve to be invited because of
~~their need, and not the former. Good manners also warrant that the needy
~~should be given priority over the affluent. Its social disadvantage is
~~that display of wealth on such occasions creates a sense of deprivation

~~treatment of the poor.
# Instead of holding sumptuous feasts on Walimah, if the Muslims shift

~~accountability in the Hereafter; otherwise they will suffer loss in both

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: In the pre-Islamic era, Arabs were greatly dejected and
~~showed resentment on the birth of a daughter, which in fact reflected
~~the status of women in society, In order to give them their rightful
~~place in the society, Islam taught its followers to recognize their
~~legitimate rights. Among the injunctions which were issued in this
~~behalf, the most important was that their proper upbringing, education
~~and training were made a means to attain Jannah so that people did not
~~only feel joy over the birth of sons but also felt pleasure on the birth
~~of daughters. In this respect, Islam is the first religion which has not
~~only ensured protection of their rights but also made full arrangements
~~for their respect and prestige in society. For instance, they have been
~~prohibited from having close contacts with men and for this purpose
~~restriction of the veil has been imposed on them. Islam has emancipated
~~them from the obligation of earning their own livelihood so that they
~~are safe from the malicious eyes of evil-minded, and secure from the
~~sexual lust of men, the way it is happening with women who are working
~~side by side with men in the West. But it is a curse indeed that due to
~~intellectual immaturity and evil trends, this freedom of women, which
~~has disgraced and robbed them of the virtues of a chaste life, is liked
~~by many people and they are trying that Muslim women should also imitate
~~the style of western women. To the people of such crooked thinking, the
~~Islamic teachings, which ensure the honour and chastity of women, appear
~~to be the yoke of slavery and they want to release women from it.

~~she-camel (of Prophet Salih) and the man who had killed her. Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) said: "When the most wicked man among them went forth
~~(to kill the she-camel).' (91:12) signifies that a distinguished, wicked
~~and most powerful chief of the people jumped up to kill the she-camel.''

~~does himself"
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: Although Islam has permitted man, in inevitable
~~circumstances, to rebuke his wife, it has also suggested a very wise
~~course for it. It has suggested that first of all he should advise and
~~preach her, and if she does not mend her ways by these means, then he
~~should stop sleeping with her, which is a great warning for the sensible
~~wife. If she does not improve even by this method, then he may take
~~recourse to slight beating, but in that he must avoid her head and face.
~~He should take recourse to beating if he thinks that it would work,
~~otherwise it is better to avoid it. But surprisingly enough some start
~~the process of reformation with beating and that too with great
~~ruthlessness which has not been permitted by Islam in any case. It is
~~this aspect which the Prophet (PBUH) has highlighted in this Hadith. He
~~has contended that when the wife is indispensable for man and it is very
~~difficult for him to pass night without her then why should he beat her
~~like a slave or bondmaid? He should try to understand that she, too, has
~~feelings and her position is like one of the two wheels of the cart of
~~life. If at all it comes to beating her then he must keep her true

~~are seven years old, and beat them for (not offering) it when they are
~~ten, and do not let (boys and girls) sleep together".
# [Abu Dawud].
# Commentary: This Hadith highlights the following points:
# 1. The importance of the prescribed five daily Salat (prayers).
# 2. When warranted by the situation, it is permissible to beat children
~~for their proper upbringing and education. But this should not be in any
~~case violent and aggressive. It should rather be done in a manner that
~~the child does not suffer any physical injury and receives the right
~~type of training. It is an absurd theory that children should be given a
~~free hand, and leave alone the corporal punishment, they should not even
~~be rebuked on doing something wrong. Suitable punishment is essential
~~for their proper training and education.
# 3. Muslim jurists have written that like Salat, other injunctions of
~~Shari`ah should also be instilled in the minds of children, and if
~~possible, they should also be given practical training for their
~~performance. For instance, they should be made to observe Saum (fast)
~~occasionally in accordance with their age and capacity during the month
~~of Ramadan, so that the importance of obligation of fasting is impressed
~~on their minds in an early age. This exercise will prove very fruitful
~~when they attain maturity. They will then be conscious that for a
~~Muslim, fasting in the month of Ramadan is compulsory like the five
~~daily Salat.
# 4. A child generally does not attain maturity at the age of ten years,
~~but nevertheless he does acquire some sense. It is, therefore, necessary
~~that rather than putting children in one bed they are provided separate
~~beds once they reach the age of 10, especially children of the opposite sex.

~~وسلم : [ يا نساء المسلمات لا تحقرن جارة لجارتها ولو فرسن شاة ] متفق عليه
# 306. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) said, "O Muslim women! No one of you should consider
~~insignificant (a gift) to give to her neighbour even if it is (a gift
~~of) the trotters of a sheep".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith means that neighbours should present gifts to
~~each other. The rich men and the poor according to their means. One who
~~is poor should not think that what he is presenting to his neighbour is
~~not worthy of giving. Even his humble gift, provided it is presented
~~with sincerity, will find acceptance with Allah. According to the Noble
~~Qur'an: "So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an ant (or a
~~small ant) shall see it.'' (99:7)
# It is, however, better for a rich person to present a gift which goes
~~well with his means. He should not give anything to his neighbour which
~~is stale or which he does not like for himself because apart from
~~insincerity, such a thing shows his contempt for the neighbour while
~~gift is, in fact, a token of sincerity and brotherhood.

~~mosque, and Messenger of Allah (PBUH) often visited it and drank from

~~attain Al-Birr (piety, righteousness - here it means Allah's reward,
~~i.e., Jannah), unless you spend (in Allah's Cause) of that which you
~~love,'' (3:92). Abu Talhah came to Messenger of Allah (PBUH), and said:
~~"Allah says in His Book: `By no means shall you attain Al-Birr, unless
~~you spend (in Allah's Cause) of that which you love,' and the dearest of
~~my property is Bairuha' so I have given it as Sadaqah (charity) for

# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: This Hadith makes clear the essentials of kindness to
~~relatives. Those kinsmen who respect and honour you, would obviously be
~~treated by you fairly. It goes without saying that people usually

~~ties of kinship but kindness for kindness. On the opposite side, there
~~is a kinsman who is rough and rude and is always bent upon severing

~~perseverance, return his harshness with politeness, maintain

# 2) To spend on the needy relatives is more meritorious than to set a

# 326. Zainab Ath-Thaqafiyah (May Allah be pleased with her) the wife of

~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) told the women that they should give Sadaqah
~~(charity), even if it should be some of their jewellery, I returned to
~~`Abdullah bin Mas`ud and said, "You are a man who does not possess much,
~~and Messenger of Allah (PBUH) has commanded us to give Sadaqah. So go
~~and ask him if giving to you will serve the purpose; otherwise, I shall
~~give it to someone else.'' He asked me that I should better go myself. I
~~went and found a woman of the Ansar at the door of Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH), waiting to ask a similar question as mine. The Prophet (PBUH)
~~was endowed with dignity, and so we could not go in. When Bilal (May
~~Allah be pleased with him) came out to us, we said to him: "Go to
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and tell him that there are two women at the
~~door who have come to ask him whether it will serve them to give Sadaqah
~~to their husbands and to orphans who are in their charge, but do not
~~tell him who we are. Bilal (May Allah be pleased with him) went in and

~~When he told him that they were a woman of the Ansar and Zainab, he
~~asked him which Zainab it was, and when he was told it was the wife of
~~`Abdullah bin Mas`ud, he (PBUH) said, "They will have a double reward,
~~one for maintaining the ties of kinship and another for Sadaqah".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. We learn from this Hadith that a woman can also give Sadaqah and
~~Zakat to her husband, provided he is poor. But its opposite is not
~~permissible. That is to say, a husband cannot pay Zakat to his wife
~~because he is responsible for her maintenance while wife is not obliged
~~to do it for her husband. So, the principle deduced from it is that one
~~who is bound to pay Zakat under the Shari`ah is not permitted to pay it
~~to his dependents.
# 2. In case of need, a woman can go out of her house subject to the
~~condition that she observes the restriction of the veil prescribed by
~~the Shari`ah in this behalf.
# 3) Like men, women should also take, keen interest in religious
~~matters. They should not feel shy of doing it.

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: In this Hadith, the Prophet (PBUH) has urged his
~~Companions to treat the Egyptians nicely for the reason of maintaining
~~the ties of kinship and for the fact that Egypt was the country of his
~~in-laws (Mariyah, the mother of Ibrahim, and one of the Prophet's wives

# [Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. This Hadith tells us that lineage in the Hereafter will not help
~~anybody. So much so that even one's relationship with Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) shall not carry any weight on that day. The only thing that will
~~then help in salvation will be one's good deeds. People for whom the
~~Prophet (PBUH) and pious men will intercede will be believers with some
~~sins in their account and not the disbelievers devoid of Faith and good
~~actions. Neither will anybody intercede for the infidels, nor will the
~~infidels find salvation.
# 2. In preaching religion, priority must be given to one's own close
~~relatives. They deserve it more than anyone else, and for this reason
~~Divine injunctions should be first of all conveyed to them.
# 3. Even if a Muslim's relatives are pagans and polytheists, their
~~rights of kinsmen and the demands of "maintaining the ties of kinship''
~~enjoined by Islam must be fulfilled. The first and foremost demand of
~~their rights is that they should be invited to the right path so that
~~they will be saved from Hell-fire.

~~`Abdullah bin `Umar (May Allah be .342 pleased with them) met a bedouin

~~anything you give them (i.e., what you have given the bedouin is too
~~much). Upon this, `Abdullah bin `Umar said, the father of this man was
~~one of `Umar's friends whom he loved best, and I heard Messenger of
~~Allah saying, "The finest act of goodness is the good treatment of
~~someone whom one's father loves".
# Another narration goes: When `Abdullah bin `Umar (May Allah be pleased

~~would get tired from the riding of the camel, and had a turban which he
~~tied round his head. One day, as he was riding the donkey, a bedouin
~~happened to pass by him. He (`Abdullah bin `Umar) said, "Aren't you so-
~~and-so?'' The bedouin said, "Yes". He (`Abdullah bin `Umar) gave him his
~~donkey and his turban and said, "Ride this donkey, and tie this turban
~~round your head". Some of his companions said, "May Allah forgive you,
~~you gave to this bedouin the donkey which you enjoyed to ride for

# Commentary: This Hadith teaches that after the death of one's parents,
~~one should maintain contact with their friends and treat them nicely.
~~Besides being a great virtue it is warranted by the needs for showing
~~compassion to relatives. To forget friends of one's parents and break
~~contact with them is condemned by the Shari`ah..

# [Abu Dawud].
# Commentary: We learn from this Hadith that one should consider the
~~life of one's parents a blessing because their life provides one with an
~~opportunity to serve them wholeheartedly, which is ordained by Allah. If
~~one wants to be nice to them after their death, one should adopt the
~~methods mentioned in this Hadith. It needs to be noted that it does not
~~mention the ceremonies like recitation of the Noble Qur'an on the third,
~~seventh and fortieth day after the death of a person, in vogue in our
~~society. All these methods of conveying the reward of virtuous deeds or
~~rites are wrong for the reason that they are neither helpful for the
~~dead nor the living. What really benefits the dead as well as living, is
~~prayer and begging forgiveness from Allah. In this Hadith, these have
~~been regarded as acts of beneficence for the deceased parents. It
~~clearly means that the children will be rewarded for the virtuous acts
~~they do for their parents and the status of the deceased parents will
~~also be elevated in the next world. The acceptance of the prayer in
~~favour of the deceased parents is also confirmed from that Hadith also
~~which tells that death brings to an end all the activities, except the
~~following:
# Firstly, an ongoing Sadaqah (Sadaqah Jariyah); like the digging of a
~~well, the building of a mosque, etc.,
# Secondly, knowledge which benefits Muslims;
# Thirdly, prayers of virtuous offspring.

~~extolled Him, and exhorted (us) and said, `Amma Ba`du. O people, I am a

# Commentary: This Hadith brings out the following points:
# 1. Messenger of Allah (PBUH) was a human being. He too was subject to
~~the inevitable law of death.
# 2. It stresses upon the establishment of a firm bond with the Book of
~~Allah (the Qur'an) and lays emphasis on showing respect and honour to

# Commentary: In this Hadith, the love and respect for the members of

~~the Prophet (PBUH). In other words, a person who loves and respects the
~~descendants of the Prophet (PBUH) will be deemed to be a lover and

~~considered devoid of the love and respect of the Prophet (PBUH). But
~~love and respect here does not mean that they are taken for sinless
~~persons and their status is exaggerated beyond reason, as is the case
~~with the Shiites. Their whole religious thinking is founded on the
~~exaggeration of the qualities of the members of the family of Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) and they have exhausted their imagination in proving
~~them sinless. While their love and respect lies in adopting the noble
~~features of their character and cherishing their piety. Their love and
~~respect does not lie in sentimental attachment with a particular family
~~and exaggerating its praise beyond all limits.

~~one who has most knowledge of the Sunnah; if they are equal in that
~~respect too, then the one who has emigrated (to Al-Madinah) first, if
~~they are equal in this respect also, then the oldest of them. No man
~~should lead another in prayer where the latter has authority, or sit in
~~his house, without his permission".
# [Muslim].
# In another narration in Muslim: Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "One
~~who is senior most in accepting Islam, should lead the Salat (prayer)".
# Yet another narration is: Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "A man who
~~is well versed in the Book of Allah and can recite it better, should
~~lead the Salat (prayer); if (all those present) are equal in this
~~respect, then the man who is senior most in respect of emigration, if

~~the prayer".
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith highlights the following three points:
# 1. The order of priority for the appointment of Imam [one who leads
~~As-Salat (the prayers) should be as follows:
# First, preference should go to a good Qari (reciter of the Noble
~~Qur'an) who is also an expert in it, provided he is pious and acts upon
~~the teachings of the Noble Qur'an faithfully. He should not be a non-
~~practising Muslim. Nowadays, we have an abundance of Imam but many of
~~them are neither pious nor faithfully act upon religious teachings. In
~~any case, where we can find a Qari who fulfills the requirements just
~~mentioned, he deserves first preference for appointment as Imam. Even a
~~religious scholar will come next to him. It must be borne in mind that
~~nice recitation of the Noble Qur'an does not mean its recitation with
~~great skill, but its essentials are elegant voice, acquaintance with the
~~`Ilm-ut-Tajwid (or science of reciting the Qur'an), clear and distinct
~~recitation.
# 2. The ruler of a territory, its highest officer and governor should
~~work as Imam in their respective areas. In the early ages of Islam,
~~these authorities used to administer their areas, dispense justice and
~~lead congregational prayers (Salat).
# 3. When one goes to somebody's house, he should not occupy the place
~~reserved for the master of the house unless he himself asks him to sit there.

~~said, "Will you take an oath whereby you will have the right to receive
~~the blood money of your murdered man?'' And mentioned the rest of the
~~Hadith.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: The author of this book, Imam Nawawi, has reproduced only
~~that portion of Hadith which is related to this chapter. This Hadith
~~makes out the following points:
# 1. The eldest person has the first right to speak in a gathering. But
~~this principle is to be followed when all the persons present there are
~~equal in virtue and intelligence; otherwise, one who is superior to
~~others in these qualities will have a prior right to speak.
# 2. The Hadith explains the issue of Qasamah which was in vogue in the
~~pre-Islamic period and was maintained by Islam. Qasamah was a mode of
~~settling cases of undetected murders. In such situations, fifty persons
~~from the heirs of the victim were asked to take an oath that murder was
~~committed by some person of that locality (or some persons from the
~~heirs were required to take oath for fifty times to this effect); after
~~this oath, the people of that area were liable to pay Diyah (blood
~~money) to the heirs of the victim. If the persons blamed for the murder
~~said on the similar oath that none of them had committed that offense,
~~they were absolved from the payment of Diyah and the payment of blood
~~money was made to the heirs of the victim from the Bait-ul-Mal (state
~~exchequer). In the incident referred in this Hadith when the Prophet
~~(PBUH) asked the brothers of the victim to take the required oath, they
~~refused to do so as they were not sure as to who had committed the
~~crime. The Prophet (PBUH) did not ask the inhabitants of Khaibar for the
~~oath because they were Jews and the heirs of the victim did not have
~~faith in them. Thus, the Prophet (PBUH) himself made the payment of the
~~blood money to the heirs of the victim.

~~The Prophet (PBUH) said, "It was shown to me in my dream that I was

# Commentary: An aged Muslim here means one who lives a pious life till

~~commits the Qur'an to memory,' who have memorized the complete Qur'an.
~~That is to say he is not aggressive in putting it into practice and does
~~not take shelter of far-fetched interpretations to justify his own

# The narration in Muslim is: The man replied: "I have made no

# Commentary: The love of the Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) for Allah
~~and His Prophet (PBUH) was not verbal only, as is the case of present-
~~day Muslims. Their love was full of obedience and submission to Allah in
~~the true sense. This is what the bedouin mentioned in this Hadith really
~~meant when he said that he had not amassed a large treasure by way of
~~Salat, Saum (fasts) and Sadaqah for presentation on the Day of
~~Resurrection. What he meant by them was voluntary acts and not the
~~obligations. The reason being that the obligatory acts like Salat, Saum
~~and Zakat are incumbent on every Muslim and no one can claim to be a
~~true believer and lover of Allah and His Prophet (PBUH) who ignores
~~them. Any Muslim who entertains true love of Allah and His Prophet
~~(PBUH), makes it evident in his practical life by his strict performance
~~of the duties and obligations enjoined by Allah and demonstrated by His
~~Prophet (PBUH) through his Sunnah. Even if such a person does not have
~~to his credit a large amount of voluntary acts, he will be declared
~~successful by Allah. This is the real import of this Hadith, otherwise a
~~Muslim's claim for the love of Allah and His Prophet (PBUH) will be void
~~if he does not fulfill his religious obligations. In fact, without the
~~fulfillment of religious obligations, his claim will be nothing short of
~~self-deception. His claim for the love of Allah and His Prophet (PBUH),
~~which is not supported by his actions will carry no weight before Allah.
~~This is what the following Ayah of the Noble Qur'an enjoins: "Say (O
~~Muhammad (PBUH) to mankind:) `If you (really) love Allah then follow me
~~(i.e., accept Islamic Tauhid, follow the Qur'an and the Sunnah), Allah
~~will love you and forgive your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most

~~372. Usair bin `Amr (Ibn Jabir) reported: When delegations from Yemen
~~came to the help of (the Muslim army at the time of Jihad) `Umar (May
~~Allah be pleased with him) would ask them, "Is there Owais bin `Amir
~~amongst you?'' (He continued searching him) until he met Owais (May
~~Allah be pleased with him). He said, "Are you Owais bin `Amir?'' He
~~said, "Yes". `Umar asked, "Are you from the Qaran branch of the tribe of
~~Murad?'' He said, "Yes". He `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) again
~~said, "Did you suffer from leucoderma and then you were cured from it
~~but for the space of a dirham?'' He said, "Yes". He `Umar (May Allah be
~~pleased with him) said, "Is your mother still alive?'' He said, "Yes".
~~He `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said, "I heard Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) saying, `There would come to you Owais bin `Amir with the
~~reinforcement from the people of Yemen. He would be from Qaran (the
~~branch) of Murad. He had been suffering from leucoderma from which he
~~was cured but for a spot of a dirham. He has a mother to whom he is very
~~dutiful. If he were to take an oath in the Name of Allah, Allah would
~~fulfill his oath. And if it is possible for you, ask him to ask
~~forgiveness for you.' So, ask forgiveness for me". He Owais (May Allah
~~be pleased with him) did so. `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) then
~~said, "Where do you intend to go?'' He said, "To Kufah.'' He `Umar (May
~~Allah be pleased with him) said, "Let me write a letter for you to its
~~governor,'' whereupon he Owais (May Allah be pleased with him) said, "I
~~love to live amongst the poor people". The following year, a person from
~~among the elite (of Kufah) performed Hajj and he met `Umar (May Allah be
~~pleased with him). `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) asked him about
~~Owais (May Allah be pleased with him). He said, "I left him in a state
~~with meagre means of sustenance in a decayed house.'' (Thereupon) `Umar
~~(May Allah be pleased with him) said, "I heard Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
~~saying, `There would come to you Owais bin `Amir of Qaran, a branch (of
~~the tribe) of Murad, along with the reinforcement of the people of
~~Yemen. He had been suffering from leucoderma which would have been cured
~~but for the space of a dirham. He has a mother to whom he is very
~~dutiful. Were he to swear, trusting Allah, for something, Allah would
~~fulfill his oath. If you can ask him to pray for forgiveness for you, do
~~so". This man went to Owais (May Allah be pleased with him) and asked
~~him to pray for forgiveness for him. Owais (May Allah be pleased with
~~him) said to him, "You have just returned from a blessed journey, it is
~~you who should pray for forgiveness for me; and did you meet `Umar?''
~~The man said, "Yes". `Owais (May Allah be pleased with him) then prayed
~~for forgiveness for him. People became aware of the high status of Owais
~~(May Allah be pleased with him) and he set out following his course.
# [Muslim].
# Another narration is: A delegation from Kufah came to `Umar (May Allah
~~be pleased with him). Among them was one who used to make fun of Owais
~~(May Allah be pleased with him). `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him)
~~enquired, "Is there anyone among you who is from Qaran?'' So this man
~~stepped forward. Then `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said, "I
~~heard Messenger of Allah (PBUH) saying, `A man will come to you from
~~Yemen named Owais. He will have left in the Yemen only his mother. He
~~was suffering from leucoderma and prayed to Allah to be cured of it. So
~~he was cured except for a space of the size of a dinar or a dirham.
~~Whoever of you should meet him should ask him to pray for forgiveness
~~for him.'''
# Another narration is: `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: "I
~~heard Messenger of Allah (PBUH) saying, `The best one of the next
~~generation (At-Tabi`un) is a man called Owais, he will have a mother and
~~he will be suffering from leucoderma. Go to him and ask him to pray for
~~forgiveness for you".
# [Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. This Hadith is one of the clear miracles of the Prophet (PBUH)
~~because he not only told the name of Owais (May Allah be pleased with
~~him) but also some of his special qualities and characteristics which
~~tallied with the description given by him.
# 2. It tells the virtues of simplicity, and anonymity.
# 3. The merit of nice treatment to mother.
# 4. This Hadith is also a proof on Owais being the best of the
~~successors to the Prophet's Companions (i.e., At-Tabi`un).
# 5. The humbleness of `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) and his
~~desire for goodness despite being in the position of the Leader of the

# Commentary: It is Mustahab (desirable) to request such a person for
~~prayer who is proceeding on a journey, especially one who is going with
~~the intention of Hajj or `Umrah. The reason being:
# 1. Prayer for someone in his absence is imbued with sincerity.
# 2. The places a pilgrim visits in the course of Hajj are such that
~~prayers made there are accepted by Allah.
# 3. It is also Mustahab that during the course of Hajj when a pilgrim
~~supplicates on special sites and occasions, he should not pray for
~~himself alone but also include his relatives and friends in his
~~supplications.
# 4. The act of praying for others goes to prove the eminence of
~~religious fraternity of the Muslims. The Prophet (PBUH) is the spiritual
~~father of the entire Muslim community, and is the most superior in
~~nobility and excellence in the whole universe, but in respect of Faith,
~~he is also a brother of all the Muslims and all the Muslims are his
~~brothers. It is illustrated by the fact that he called `Umar (May Allah
~~be pleased with him) his brother.

# 2. The love of Allah and His Prophet (PBUH) is the cornerstone of the

# 386. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) said, "Allah, the Exalted, has said: `I will declare war
~~against him who treats with hostility a pious worshipper of Mine. And
~~the most beloved thing with which My slave comes nearer to Me, is what I
~~have enjoined upon him; and My slave keeps on coming closer to Me
~~through performing Nawafil (voluntary prayers or doing extra deeds
~~besides what is obligatory) until I love him, (so much so that) I become
~~his hearing with which he hears, and his sight with which he sees, and
~~his hand with which he strikes, and his leg with which he walks; and if
~~he asks Me something, I will surely give him, and if he seeks My
~~Protection (refuge), I will surely protect him".
# [Al-Bukhari]
# Commentary: This Hadith tell us the status and distinctive signs of
~~the favoured men of Allah ('Auliya' Allah) The Noble Qur'an has defined
~~them as:
# "Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allah) and used to fear Allah
~~much (by abstaining from evil deeds and sins and by doing righteous
~~deeds)". (10:63).
# According to this definition, every believer who really fears Allah is
~~a favoured of Allah. It means that except for Faith and piety, favoured
~~of Allah are neither people of the special kind nor have they any
~~special distinctive signs, as is generally thought by some people. In
~~this respect, the ignorance of the general public is shocking because
~~they regard even such persons as favoured of Allah who not only neglect
~~the religious obligations and the practice of the Prophet (PBUH), but
~~also woefully lack cleanliness. Sometimes they call even mad or half-mad
~~persons as favourites of Allah, whereas a Wali in the true sense is one
~~who is meticulous about observing the obligations and is fearful of Allah.
# This Hadith brings about the following four points:
# Firstly, the love of those whom Allah loves entail the love of Allah,
~~and hating them entails the hatred of Allah..
# Secondly, when a true Muslim acquires nearness and love of Allah by
~~means of performing religious obligations, supererogatory and voluntary
~~prayers, Allah then becomes his special helper and protects his limbs
~~and organs and does not let them work for His disobedience. Then he does
~~not use any part of his body for things which are disliked by Him. It is
~~wrong to infer from this Hadith, as men of heretical and polytheistic
~~trend try to do, that Auliya' become the eyes, ears, hands, feet, etc.
~~of Allah. That is to say that Almighty Allah descends in them. Thus, on
~~the basis of this contemptible reasoning, they conclude that it makes no
~~difference whether one begs from Allah or Auliya because the two are one
~~being. For such people supplicating "O Allah! Help us'', "O Prophet of
~~Allah! Help us'' and "O Ali! Help us'' etc., are all right. One who says
~~so has certainly gone astray, rather commits Shirk (polytheism). May
~~Allah save us from these sins. According to the Hadith, a true pious man
~~likes and adopts what is liked by Allah, and avoids all such things
~~which are not liked by Him.
# Thirdly, the performance of the obligatory acts of worshipping has the
~~first and foremost importance for attaining the pleasure of Allah
~~because their fulfillment is liked the most by Allah and also because
~~they furnish the foundation, on which the edifice of Islam is built. As
~~we cannot think of a building without foundation, similarly, we cannot
~~think of voluntary worship without fulfilling the basic obligations. The
~~fact is that one who neglects them ceases to be a Muslim. This is the
~~reason for the severe warnings of Allah to those who default on this
~~account. Those who neglect voluntary prayers have not been given any
~~warning. It is, however, true that their performance in addition to the
~~obligatory ones increases lustre of obligations. Nawafil (voluntary acts
~~of worship) help one to attain the exalted place of being loved by Allah
~~by virtue of which one is endowed with the special Help of Allah.
# Fourthly, Almighty Allah certainly grants the prayers of those whom He
~~loves. But acceptance of their prayers, however, does not mean that
~~their results appear at once. Sometime the results of these prayers
~~appear after a long time. The prayer of virtuous persons is certainly
~~granted but whether it takes a long or short time depends solely on the
~~Will of Allah.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith brings out the following three points:
# 1. The objective of Jihad. This objective warrants that one must
~~struggle against Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (polytheism) and the worship
~~of falsehood in all its forms. Jihad has to continue until this
~~objective is achieved. This contention is supported by a Hadith, to the
~~effect that Jihad will continue till the Day of Resurrection. In this
~~Hadith the word (An-Nas) translated above as "people" stands for the
~~polytheists and idolaters. The reason being that other Nasus (pl. of
~~Nass, meaning `text') confirm the exemption of Ahl-ul-Kitab (people of
~~the Scriptures) from it subject to the condition that they agree to pay
~~Jizyah (dues imposed by Islam on the people of the Book living under the
~~protection of an Islamic state) and submit to the Muslim rule. The Arab
~~pagans have only the choice to either embrace Islam or face war. In the
~~latter case, it is incumbent on the Mulsims to wage Jihad against them
~~to wipe out Kufr and Shirk and raise the banner of Tauhid everywhere.
# This Hadith strongly refutes the people who distort the Islamic
~~concept of Jihad and hold that Islam preaches defensive war only. It is
~~an apologetic approach because defensive war has to be fought in any
~~case by every nation and country. Thus, it is a compulsion and needs no
~~justification. The real distinction of Islam lies in its enjoining
~~Muslims to wage war for upholding the truth beside fighting for their
~~own defense. The domination of Kufr, Shirk and falsehood is darkness,
~~heresy and tyranny, and the objective of Islam is to purge the world of
~~all these evils. It aims at liberating man from the worship of man, set
~~them on the path of worship of Allah, and to provide a just and
~~equitable society to mankind. Wherever in the world there is tyranny,
~~ignorance and heresy, Muslims are bound to fight such evils and finish
~~them by means of Jihad.
# There is also a third form of Jihad which is waged against countries
~~where Muslims are victims of aggression, suppression and cruelties of
~~the non-Muslims. It is incumbent upon Muslims to liberate their brethren
~~in Faith from the clutches of the non-Muslims by means of Jihad. So long
~~Muslims performed this obligation with a sense of duty, Islam and its
~~followers were dominant in the world and ever since they have ignored
~~this obligation, both are in subjugation and disgrace. In other words,
~~the secret of power and stability of Muslims lies in Jihad. Muslims need
~~to understand this secret like their ancestors.
# 2. Life and property of every person is secured after his joining the
~~fold of Islam. He will, however, be subject to the law of Islam, one of
~~which is payment of Zakat. If he murders any Muslim, he will also be
~~killed in return, unless the heirs of the victim pardon the murderer or
~~accept blood-money (Diyah) for it.
# 3. When a person embraces Islam, the laws of Shari`ah apply to him
~~according to his apparent condition only. His heart will not be probed
~~for this purpose. In case, he is not sincere or he has some design in
~~joining the fold of Islam, no action will be taken against him until
~~guilt is fully proved. What he has in his heart will be left to Allah
~~Who will pass judgement on his intention on the Day of Resurrection.
~~This Hadith is related to this chapter for its third point. In their
~~debate on this point, some `Ulama' have contended that such people who
~~believe in Tauhid and obey the injunctions of Shari`ah are not to be
~~declared as infidels.

~~fight together, and he cuts off my hands with his sword, then hides from
~~me behind a tree and (then) says he has submitted himself to Allah.
~~Shall I kill him after he has said it?'' He (PBUH) replied, "Do not kill
~~him.'' I submitted, "But O Messenger of Allah, he cut off one of my
~~hands and only then he said it.'' Messenger of Allah (PBUH) then
~~replied, "Do not kill him, for if you do so, he will be in the position
~~in which you were before you killed him (i.e., he will be considered a
~~Muslim and thus his life will be inviolable), and you will be in the
~~position in which he was before he made his testimony (i.e., your life
~~will not be inviolable, for his heirs can ask for Qisas)".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith tells us that injunctions of Islam will be
~~enforced on a person according to his apparent condition not his
~~insight. The reason being that nobody is capable of knowing the insight
~~of others. When a person professes Islam, we have to accept him a
~~Muslim; and it will be our duty to protect his life and property. If, in
~~spite of knowing that his life and property are sacred, a Muslim murders
~~him, then it will be quite fair for the heirs of the victim to have
~~Qisas for the murder. If the murderer poses ignorance or takes shelter
~~of some reason, then he will be liable for Diyah only. The Prophet
~~(PBUH) arranged payment of Diyah to the heirs of the victim in the case
~~mentioned in this Hadith because some of the Companions of the Prophet
~~(PBUH) had advanced the argument that the murderer had slain the victim
~~on the presumption that he had professed Islam just to save his life.

~~from the Ansar and I caught hold of a man (of the defeated tribe). When

~~him with my spear and killed him. By the time we went back to Al-

~~him peace and security, and treat him as a near one. We have nothing to
~~do with his insight. Allah will call him to account for that. But
~~whosoever shows evil to us, we shall not grant him security nor shall we
~~believe him, even if he professed that his intention is good.''
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: This Hadith also proves that the injunctions go with the
~~apparent acts of a person and not with will and intention. It also
~~indicates that a good intention does not waive the Qisas and

# Allah, the Exalted, says:
# "And fear none but Me". (2:40)
# "Verily, (O Muhammad (PBUH)) the Grip (punishment) of your Rubb is
~~severe". (85:12)
# "Such is the Seizure of your Rubb when He seizes the (population of)
~~towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His Seizure is painful, (and)
~~severe. Indeed in that (there) is a sure lesson for those who fear the
~~torment of the Hereafter. That is a Day whereon mankind will be gathered
~~together, and that is a Day when all (the dwellers of the heavens and
~~the earth) will be present. And We delay it only for a term (already)
~~fixed. On the Day when it comes, no person shall speak except by His
~~(Allah's) Leave. Some among them will be wretched and (others) blessed.
~~As for those who are wretched, they will be in the Fire, sighing in a
~~high and low tone". (11:102-106)
# "And Allah warns you against Himself (His punishment)". (3:30)
# "That Day shall a man flee from his brother. And from his mother and
~~his father. And from his wife and his children. Every man that Day will
~~have enough to make him careless of others". (80:34-37)
# "O mankind! Fear your Rubb and be dutiful to Him! Verily, the
~~earthquake of the Hour (of Resurrection) is a terrible thing. The Day
~~you shall see it, every nursing mother will forget her nursling, and
~~every pregnant one will drop her load, and you shall see mankind as in a
~~drunken state, yet they will not be drunken, but severe will be the
~~Torment of Allah". (22:1,2)
# "But for him who fears the standing before his Rubb, there will be two
~~Gardens (i.e., in Jannah)". (55:46)
# "And some of them draw near to others, questioning. Saying:
~~`Aforetime, we were afraid (of the punishment of Allah) in the midst of
~~our families. So Allah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from
~~the torment of the Fire. Verily, we used to invoke Him (Alone and none
~~else) before. Verily, He is Al-Barr (the Most Subtle, Kind, Courteous,
~~and Generous), the Most Merciful.". (52:25-28)

~~أربعين يوما ثم يكون علقة مثل ذلك ثم يكون مضغة مثل ذلك ثم يرسل الملك
~~فينفخ فيه الروح ويؤمر بأربع كلمات : بكتب رزقه وأجله وعمله وشقي أو سعيد .
~~فوالذي لا إله غيره إن أحدكم ليعمل بعمل أهل الجنة حتى ما يكون بينه وبينها

~~بعمل أهل الجنة فيدخلها ] متفق عليه
# 396. `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH), the truthful and the receiver of the truth
~~informed us, saying, "The creation of you (humans) is gathered in the
~~form of semen in the womb of your mother for forty days, then it becomes
~~a clinging thing in similar (period), then it becomes a lump of flesh
~~like that, then Allah sends an angel who breathes the life into it; and
~~(the angel) is commanded to record four things about it: Its provision,
~~its term of life (in this world), its conduct; and whether it will be
~~happy or miserable. By the One besides Whom there is no true god!
~~Verily, one of you would perform the actions of the dwellers of Jannah
~~until there is only one cubit between him and it (Jannah), when what is
~~foreordained would come to pass and he would perform the actions of the
~~inmates of Hell until he enter it. And one of you would perform the
~~actions of the inmates of Hell, until there is only one cubit between
~~him and Hell. Then he would perform the acts of the dwellers of Jannah
~~until he would enter it.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith deals with the problem of fate in which Faith
~~is essential. What it means is that Almighty Allah already knows about
~~every person, whether he will be pious or impious, whether he will go to
~~Jannah or Hell. He has already recorded all this. But it does not mean
~~that man is absolutely helpless and is deprived of will and power, as is
~~believed by some deviant sects who have gone astray. Fate is in fact a
~~manifestation of the Knowledge of Allah and it has nothing to do with
~~the will and intention of a person. Allah has not created man as a
~~helpless creature, but has endowed him with the freedom of will and
~~action, because in the absence of these two qualities, there would be no
~~justification for his trial. He could only be put to test if he was
~~granted not only the ability to choose between good and evil but also
~~the freedom to act. For this purpose, Almighty Allah, has clearly
~~indicated to man both the paths and granted him freedom to choose
~~whichever he likes. He has also told him the ultimate end of each. The
~~Noble Qur'an says:
# "Verily, We showed him the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful". (76:3)
# "Then whosoever wills, let him believe; and whosoever wills, let him
~~disbelieve". (18:29).
# But by mentioning this Hadith in the chapter relating to the fear of
~~Allah, Imam An-Nawawi has warned that we should be fearful of Allah,
~~pray for His Help, and an auspicious end of our life. He has advised us
~~to adopt whatever means are available to us. In other words, we should
~~make Faith and piety a way of life because one can find the means and
~~resources according to one's capacity. Since nobody knows the result of
~~his endeavours, one should leave it to Allah and rest assured that He
~~Who has created him with a purpose will also create the ways and means
~~to attain it. He who adopts piety, the ways to piety will open for him;
~~and he who adopts evil, the ways to evil will open for him.
# A Muslim should never go towards evil at any stage of his life, lest
~~his life comes to an end suddenly and he is deprived of the reward of
~~all the good deeds he has done during his life and consequently he is
~~consigned to Hell rather than Jannah. May Allah save us from a bad end
~~and such actions which lead one to Hell.

# [ الخنين ] بالخاء المعجمة : هو البكاء مع غنة وانتشاق الصوت من الأنف
# 401. Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) delivered a Khutbah to us the like of which I
~~had never heard from him before. He said, "If you knew what I know, you
~~would laugh little and weep much". Thereupon those present covered their
~~faces and began sobbing.
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Another narration is: Messenger of Allah (PBUH) heard of something
~~about his Companions upon which he addressed them and said, "Jannah and
~~(Hell) Fire were shown to me and I have never seen the like of this day
~~in good and in evil. If you were to know what I know, you would laugh
~~little and weep much". His Companions experienced such suffering on that
~~day that had no equal. They covered their faces and began to weep.
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary:
# 1. We learn from this Hadith that Jannah and Hell do exist. The
~~Prophet (PBUH) was shown both of them.
# 2. Excessive laughing is improper because it indicates that one is
~~careless and forgetful of the Hereafter, while a Muslim is required to
~~be all the time alert and careful about it.
# 3. To weep out of fear of Allah, is praiseworthy because it indicates
~~that one's heart is full of fear and he is worried about the Hereafter.

~~أمسافة الأرض أم الميل الذي يكحل به العين ) فيكون الناس على قدر أعمالهم

# ومنهم من يكون إلى حقويه ومنهم من يلجمه العرق إلجاما ] وأشار رسول الله
~~صلى الله عليه وسلم بيده إلى فيه . رواه مسلم
# 402. Al-Miqdad (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) said, "On the Day of Resurrection, the sun will come so
~~close to people that there would be left only a distance of one Meel''.
~~Sulaim bin `Amir said: By Allah, I do not know whether he meant by
~~"Meel'', the mile of the distance measure or the stick used for applying
~~antimony powder to the eye. (Messenger of Allah (PBUH) is, however,
~~reported to have said:) "The people then will be submerged in
~~perspiration according to their deeds, some up to their ankles, some up
~~to their knees, some up to the waist and some will have the bridle of
~~perspiration (reaching their mouth and nose) and, while saying this
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) pointed to his mouth with his hand".
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: It is not clear whether the Arabic word (Meel) in this
~~Hadith is for the mileage or is the stick used for applying antimony. A
~~mile consists of eight furlongs. Some of the commentators of Hadith hold
~~that it comprises four thousand Dhira`. Hafiz Ibn Hajar is of the
~~opinion that it is equal to twelve thousand human steps. (For detail
~~please see the book `Mir'atul Mafatih' Chapter Salat-us-Safar). If it
~~stands for the mileage even then it gives an idea of the heat of the
~~sun. Although it is billions of miles away from the earth but one cannot
~~bear its heat in summer. When the sun shall be at a distance of one
~~mile, its heat shall be so intense that people would be immersed in
~~sweat. May Allah save us from it.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith has already been mentioned. Here it has been

~~hear; heaven has squeaked, and it has right to do so. By Him, in Whose
~~Hand my soul is, there is not a space of four fingers in which there is
~~not an angel who is prostrating his forehead before Allah, the Exalted.
~~By Allah, if you knew what I know, you would laugh little, weep much,
~~and you would not enjoy women in beds, but would go out to the open
~~space beseeching Allah".
# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary:
# 1. This Hadith also highlights the importance of fear of Allah because
~~the more awareness a Muslim has of the Majesty and Magnificence of
~~Allah, the greater shall be the terror in his heart for His punishment
~~and hope of His Mercy. With this state of mind, he will perform greater
~~acts of obedience and abstain more rigidly from sins.
# 2. The Hadith also mentions the heaven teeming with angels who are all
~~the time prostrating before Allah in worship. When this is the condition
~~of the angels, who do not slack for a moment in the obedience of Allah,
~~how important it is for man to worship Him because he is all the time
~~violating commands of Allah. It is, therefore, incumbent on man to obey
~~Allah and always seek His Help and Refuge.

# 407. Abu Barzah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of

~~before he is asked about his life, how did he consume it, his knowledge,
~~what did he do with it, his wealth, how did he earn it and how did he
~~dispose of it, and about his body, how did he wear it out.''
# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary:
# 1. This Hadith first of all highlights the importance and value of
~~this transitory life, every breath of which is invaluable. Not a moment
~~of it should, therefore, be wasted in the disobedience of Allah because
~~one shall also be made to account for it.
# 2. Man shall also be answerable for his knowledge. Here, we find an
~~inducement for acquiring religious knowledge because that alone is
~~beneficial for him. He should make use of his knowledge for winning the
~~pleasure of Allah. If he does not do that then he must think about the
~~justification for not doing so. He must also think how he would be
~~facing Allah on the Day of Resurrection.
# 3. The question in respect of wealth raised in this Hadith clearly
~~shows that one should earn wealth by legitimate means only and spend it
~~strictly in a lawful manner. If he takes to unfair means of income or
~~squanders it, he will be sinful and required to account for the
~~violation of the Divine injunctions.
# 4. One should protect his body from everything that is unlawful and
~~force himself to submit to the Divine injunctions. When he is asked to
~~account for neglecting them, it will be difficult for him to escape the
~~consequences of accountability.
# In short, this Hadith makes one conscious of the accountability so
~~that one keeps it all the time in view so that he will be saved from
~~humiliation on the Day of Resurrection. How nice would it really be if
~~one bears the accountability of the Day of Resurrection always in mind!

# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary:
# 1. This Hadith tells us about the fear of Allah and the fright of the
~~Hereafter entertained by the Prophet (PBUH) and his Companions. It has a
~~lesson for us that how, in spite of being innocent and having the
~~assurance of the forgiveness of Allah, they were always fearful of Allah
~~and the horrors of the Day of Resurrection. As against them, we are
~~immersed in sins, neglect and violate the Divine injunctions day and

# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: Imam At-Taibi has stated that the Prophet (PBUH) mentioned
~~this example for travellers to the Hereafter, because Satan is sitting
~~on this passage and man's self and his false desires are his helpers. If
~~a person is wide-awake in his travel and exercises caution in his
~~activities, he is not only saved from the vices of Satan, but his own
~~false desires also do not stand in his way. The Prophet (PBUH) also
~~pointed out that the way to the Hereafter is very hard and littered with
~~great impediments and obstructions and it is by no means easy to
~~traverse it. Jannah is an invaluable gift and unless man gives the
~~sacrifice of his life and wealth, he will not become eligible for
~~entering it. "Allah has purchased the lives and properties of Muslims
~~for Jannah". (Tuhfatul Ahwadhi).

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Another narration in Muslim is: the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said,
~~"Whosoever testifies that there is no true god except Allah and that
~~Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, Allah (SWT) saves him from the Fire
~~(of Hell)".
# Commentary: This Hadith confirms that all Prophets of Allah were men
~~and thus refutes those who attribute divinity to them and exclude them
~~from the category of men or regard them a part of Allah, as Christians
~~believes Prophet `Isa (Jesus to be Christ) by regarding him Allah or His
~~son, or the Jews do Prophet `Uzair by venerating him as son of Allah.
~~The misconception has also taken hold of a sect of the Muslims. They
~~have invented the belief that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is "Light from the
~~Light of Allah". Thus further considering to be of him with Divine
~~qualities. They exclude him from the category of men. This Hadith tells
~~us that the belief that Prophets were men constitutes part of Faith and
~~denial of it is the denial of a part of Faith and amounts to evasion
~~from Tauhid - Oneness of Allah.
Prophet `Isa (Jesus) has been referred in the Qur'an as "Kalimatullah"
~~(the Word of Allah) (4:171). What these words really mean is that he was
~~born in an unusual manner, without being fathered by anyone, only on the
~~express fiat of Allah.
# This Hadith shows that a major sin does not cast a Muslim out of the
~~fold of Islam, as is believed by certain deviant sects who have gone
~~astray. Such a person does remain a Muslim and his eligibility for
~~admission into Jannah also remains intact but his admission entirely
~~depends on the pleasure of Allah. He may forgive a sinful Muslim and
~~send him to Jannah even in the initial stage or keep him in Hell for
~~sometime and then send him to Jannah. Thus, when it is said that Muslims
~~are protected against Hell, it means that they will not abide in Hell
~~for ever. It will be a temporary phase varying with his sins. When that
~~punishment comes to an end, or even before it, when Almighty, Allah,
~~wills, he will be removed from Hell to Jannah.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: Imam At-Taibi says that the honesty of heart means
~~firmness of faith and arrangement of actions which will provide evidence
~~of Tauhid and Risalah (Oneness of Allah and the Prophethood of Muhammad
~~(PBUH)). Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar states that Imam At-Taibi has made this
~~elaboration to remove the ambiguity which arises from the wording of the
~~Hadith because it is generally held by Ahadith that one who bears
~~witness to Tauhid and Risalah will not go to Hell, while Ahlus-Sunnah
~~hold that it stands proved by concrete arguments that sinful Muslims
~~will be consigned to Hell and then brought out from it by intercession.
~~It shows that for the determination of real meanings of this Hadith we
~~shall have to keep in view other related arguments as well. These
~~meanings are riveted with good deeds. In other words, one who bears
~~witness to Tauhid and Risalah and fulfills Islamic injunctions and
~~obligations and requirements of Faith and fear of Allah, will not be
~~consigned to Hell. Some scholars are of the opinion that this Hadith
~~refers to such people who truly repented and renounced Kufr and Shirk
~~and wholeheartedly professed Tauhid and Risalah but died soon after that
~~and thus did not get an opportunity to do good deeds. Such people will
~~certainly go to Jannah.
# This Hadith leads to the conclusion that ordinary people should not be
~~told things the true meanings of which they find difficult to grasp and
~~accomplish evil deeds relying on such glad tidings.

# 416. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) or may be Abu Sa`id
~~Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: On the day of the
~~battle of Tabuk, the Muslims were hard pressed by hunger and they asked
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH): "O Messenger of Allah, grant us permission to
~~slaughter our camels to eat and use their fat". He (PBUH) accorded
~~permission. On this `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) came and said:
~~"O Messenger of Allah, if it is done, we shall suffer from lack of
~~transportation. I suggest you pool together whatever has been left and
~~supplicate Allah to bless it.'' Allah will bestow His Blessing upon it.
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) agreed and called for leather mat and had it
~~spread out, and asked people to bring the provisions left over. They
~~started doing it. One brought a handful of corn, another brought a
~~handful of dates, a third brought a piece of bread; thus some provisions
~~were collected on the mat. Messenger of Allah (PBUH) invoked blessings,
~~and then said, "Now take it up in your vessels". Everyone filled his
~~vessel with food, so that there was not left a single empty vessel in
~~the whole camp. All of them ate to their fill and there was still some
~~left over. Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Any slave who meets Allah,
~~testifying there is no true god except Allah, and that I am His
~~Messenger, without entertaining any doubt about these (two
~~fundamentals), will not be banished from entering Jannah.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith mentions a miracle of the Prophet (PBUH) and
~~the effect of his prayer by means of which a small quantity of food
~~sufficed the whole army. The exact number of Muslims who took part in
~~the battle of Tabuk is not mentioned in any reliable account. Al-Hafiz
~~Ibn Hajar has stated, with reference to some narratives of Fath Al-Bari
~~mentioned in connection with the biography of the Prophet (PBUH) and the
~~wars he had fought in the way of Allah, that they numbered thirty to
~~forty thousand men.
# Although these figures are open to question but one can safely infer
~~from these figures that their number was very large. According to Sahih
~~Al-Bukhari: "A large number of Muslims participated with the Prophet
~~(PBUH) in this war. Their number was so large that they could not be
~~described in a register. It was difficult for the Prophet (PBUH) to
~~discover who was absent except that he was informed about him by
~~Allah.'' (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Kitab Al-Maghazi, Bab Ghazwah Tabuk, Hadith
~~Ka`b bin Malik). This extract goes to prove that although the number of
~~Muslims who took part in this war was very large the provisions weighing
~~a few seers only sufficed for them all.
# We also learn from this Hadith that one who is blessed with the Grace
~~of Allah, can offer advice to a person who is superior to him on this
~~account. Similarly, the one who is superior in virtue should listen to
~~the advice of those who are inferior to him because there is every
~~possibility that their advice may offer something better. It does not
~~harm either of them. Neither does it detract from the superiority of the
~~superior nor can it be regarded an affront of a junior.

~~me and those people. Whenever it rained, it became difficult for me to

~~that I could reserve that as a Musalla (place for prayer).'' Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) said, "I will do so". So Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and
~~Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) came to my house the (next)
~~morning after the sun had risen high. Messenger of Allah (PBUH) asked my
~~permission to enter and I admitted him. He did not sit before saying,
~~"Where do you want us to offer Salat in your house?'' I pointed to the
~~place where I wanted him to offer prayers. So Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
~~stood up for the prayer and started the prayer with Takbir and we
~~aligned in rows behind him; and he offered two Rak`ah prayer and
~~finished them with Taslim, and we also performed Taslim with him. I
~~detained him for a meal called Khazirah which I had prepared for him.
~~(Khazirah is a special type of dish prepared from barley flour and meat

~~see him?'' One of them replied, "He is a hypocrite and does not love
~~Allah and His Messenger". On that Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Don't
~~say this. Haven't you seen that he testified that there is no true god
~~except Allah,' for Allah's sake only.'' The man replied, "Allah and His
~~Messenger know better, but by Allah, we never saw him but helping and

# 421. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The
~~Prophet (PBUH) said, "Allah, the Exalted, and Glorious said: `A slave
~~committed a sin and he said: O Allah, forgive my sin,' and Allah said:
~~`My slave committed a sin and then he realized that he has a Rubb Who
~~forgives the sins and punishes for the sin.' He then again committed a
~~sin and said: `My Rubb, forgive my sin,' and Allah (SWT) said: `My slave
~~committed a sin and then realized that he has a Rubb Who forgives his
~~sin and punishes for the sin.' He again committed a sin and said: `My
~~Rubb, forgive my sin,' and Allah (SWT) said: `My slave has committed a
~~sin and then realized that he has a Rubb Who forgives the sin or takes
~~(him) to account for sin. I have granted forgiveness to my slave. Let
~~him do whatever he likes".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# The last sentence "let him do..". means, as long he keeps asking for
~~forgiveness after the commission of sins, and repents, Allah will
~~forgive him because repentance eliminates previous sins". (Editor's Note)
# Commentary: This Hadith tells us that so long as the heart of a Muslim
~~remains free from willful disobedience of Divine injunctions and he does
~~not deliberately neglect his religious duties, that is to say he goes on
~~committing sins and each time wholeheartedly begs pardon for them,
~~Almighty, Allah will forgive him. The reason being that he is penitent
~~for his wrongs and does not insist upon them for fear of accountability.
~~This condition of his shows that his heart is full of awe and Majesty of
~~Allah and he does not feel any disgrace in showing his utter humbleness
~~before Him. Now this is a merit of the sinful which is pleasing to
~~Allah. Thus, He says that so long as his slave continues submission and
~~prostration He will go on forgiving him.
# On the contrary, there is a person who goes on committing sins but he
~~neither repents for them nor seeks pardon for his wrongs; nor has any
~~fear of accountability. Obviously, he is altogether different from the
~~kind of Muslims mentioned before, and he will be therefore treated
~~differently by Allah. The conduct of the former is of a Muslim who, in
~~spite of his sins, is liked by Allah while the second is of that of a
~~rebel for whom He has kept severe punishment ready. May Allah rank us
~~among the former category of people.

~~438. Abu Najih `Amr bin `Abasah (May Allah be pleased with him)
~~reported: In the Pre-Islamic Period of Ignorance, I used to think that
~~people who used to worship idols, were deviated and did not adhere to
~~the true religion. Then I heard of a man in Makkah who was preaching a
~~message. So I mounted my camel and went to him. I found that (this man
~~who was) Messenger of Allah (PBUH) remained hidden because of the
~~persecution by his people. I had entered Makkah stealthily and when I
~~met him I asked him, "Who are you?'' He (PBUH) said, "I am a Prophet.''
~~I asked; "What is a Prophet?'' He said, "Allah has sent me (with a
~~message)". I asked, "With what has He sent you?'' He said, "He sent me
~~to strengthen the ties of kinship, to destroy idols so that Allah alone
~~should be worshipped and nothing should be associated with Him". I
~~asked, "Who has followed you in this?'' He said, "A freeman and a
~~slave". (At that time only Abu Bakr and Bilal (May Allah be pleased with
~~her) were with him). I said, "I shall follow you". He said, "You can not
~~do that now. Do you not see my situation and that of the people? Go to
~~your people, and when you hear that my cause has prevailed, come to me".
~~So I went back to my people, and while I was with my people, Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) emigrated to Al-Madinah. I continued to ask people about
~~him till some of my people visited Al-Madinah. On their return, I asked
~~them, "How is that man who has arrived in Al-Madinah faring?'' They
~~said, "People are hastening to him. His own people had planned to kill
~~him but did not succeed.'' Then I went to Al-Madinah and came to him and
~~said, "O Messenger of Allah, do you recognize me?'' He (PBUH) said,
~~"Yes, you are the one who met me in Makkah.'' I said, "O Messenger of
~~Allah, tell me of that which Allah has taught you and of which I am
~~unaware. Tell me about Salat first.'' He (PBUH) replied, "Perform the
~~Fajr (morning) Salat, then stop Salat until the sun has risen up to the
~~height of a lance, for when it rises, it rises up between the horns of
~~the devil, and the infidels prostrate themselves before it at that time.
~~Then perform Salat, for Salat is witnessed and angels attend it, until
~~the shadow becomes equal to the length of its object; then stop Salat,
~~for at that time Jahannam (Hell) is heated up. Then pray when the shadow
~~becomes longer, for the prayer is witnessed and angels attend it, until
~~you perform `Asr prayer; then stop Salat till sun sets, for it sets
~~between the horns of a devil. At that time the infidels prostrate
~~themselves before it.'' I then asked the Messenger of Allah to tell me
~~about Wudu', and he (PBUH) said, "When a person begins the Wudu' and
~~washes his mouth and nose, the sins committed by his face, mouth and
~~nostrils are washed out. Then when he washes his face as commanded by
~~Allah, the sins of his face are washed out with the water from the sides
~~of his beard. Then when he washes his hands up to elbows, the sins of
~~his hands are washed out through his fingers with water. Then he passes
~~his wet hands over his head and the sins of the head are washed out
~~through the ends of his hair with water. Then he washes his feet up to
~~the ankles, the sins of his feet are washed out through his toes with
~~water. Then, if he stands up for Salat and praises Allah, glorifies Him,
~~proclaims His Greatness as He deserves and devotes his heart wholly to
~~Allah, he emerges sin free as the day he was born".
# When `Amr bin `Abasah (May Allah be pleased with him) narrated this
~~Hadith to Abu Umamah (May Allah be pleased with him) a Companion of the
~~Prophet (PBUH), the latter said to him, "Watch what you are saying. O
~~`Amr bin `Abasah, a man will be getting all of this in one shot?'' `Amr
~~(May Allah be pleased with him) replied, "O Abu Umamah, I have attained
~~old age, my bones have become dry, my death is approaching and there is
~~no need for me to tell lies concerning Allah and His Messenger (PBUH).
~~Had I not heard this from the Messenger of Allah only once, twice,
~~thrice (and he counted up to seven) I would never have reported it.
~~Indeed I have heard this frequently".
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith makes the following seven points:
# 1. The preacher should be concerned about the safety of his followers.
~~It is for this reason, the Prophet (PBUH) stressed upon `Amr bin Abasah
~~(May Allah be pleased with him) to stay at home and keep his conversion
~~to Islam secret.
# 2. No matter how unfavourable are the circumstances and how tough is
~~the opposition, a preacher should always have firm hope of help from
~~Allah and be confident about his victory over his enemy. That is why,
~~the Prophet (May Allah be pleased with him) asked `Amr (May Allah be
~~pleased with him) to come to him when he received information about his
~~domination.
# 3. It is a proof of his Prophethood that what eventually happened was
~~exactly according to his prophecy.
# 4. Angels attend the Salat. One should, therefore, perform Salat not
~~only with peace of mind but also with utmost humility and fear of Allah,
~~so that it is reported and becomes more meritorious.
# 5. The times when Salat is unpraiseworthy are as follows:
# a. After the Salat of Fajr to the time of sunrise.
# b. At the time when the sun begins to decline.
# c. After the Salat of `Asr to the time of sunset.
# d. When the sun is rising or setting.
# 6. Wudu' and Salat expiate for sins. For this reason this Hadith has
~~been mentioned in this chapter.
# 7. Even in the Days of Ignorance (pre-Islamic period), pious and
~~right-minded people were averse to idolatry and thought it a deviation
~~from the Right Path

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith highlights the merits of expecting good
~~treatment of Allah. But this has to be backed by good actions, in the
~~same way as one can hope for good results after ploughing and sowing
~~seeds. It is obvious that one who accomplishes good deeds will expect
~~good consequences, and one who does evil deeds will expect evil
~~consequences. Allah will treat people according to their expectation

# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary:
# 1. What it really means is that if sins of a Muslim, committed in

~~repents wholeheartedly for his sins, makes penitence for them and begs

# 2. Shirk (polytheism) is an absolutely unpardonable sin. All other

~~will pardon them if He likes and send the sinful persons straight to

~~corpse) will say: `Take me in haste'; but if he was not, it will say (to
~~its bearers): `Woe to it. Where are you taking it?' Everything except

# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: The speech of a dead is a matter of the realm of the

# 1. This Hadith brings into prominence the distinction of Abu Bakr As-

~~and left the food untouched.
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: This Hadith tells us about the hospitality of the
~~Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) and the respect they had for each other.
# Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf (May Allah be pleased with him) was one of the
~~figures of `Al-Ashratul-Mubash-sharun bil Jannah (the ten Companions of
~~the Prophet (PBUH) who were given the glad tidings of entering Jannah
~~during their lifetime). For this reason, he is superior to Mus`ab bin
~~`Umair (May Allah be pleased with him), but he acknowledged him superior
~~on the consideration of his martyrdom and poverty through which he had
~~passed. He holds Mus`ab bin `Umair (May Allah be pleased with him)
~~better on the grounds that he had confronted the infidels in extremely
~~difficult circumstances and sacrificed his life for the sake of Allah.
# The second point which this Hadith brings out is the fear which Abdur-
~~Rahman bin `Auf (May Allah be pleased with him) felt at the abundance of
~~wealth and property, although he used to spend his wealth and riches in
~~the way of Allah and Jihad. Today, the only purpose of our wealth is
~~that we waste it either on foolish customs and ceremonies of marriage or
~~construction of buildings and their decoration. It was this abundance of
~~wealth of which the Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) were afraid. The
~~Prophet (PBUH) had himself expressed great anxiety over it.

# Allah, the Exalted, says:
# "Verily, the likeness of (this) worldly life is as the water (rain)
~~which We send down from the sky; so by it arises the intermingled
~~produce of the earth of which men and cattle eat: until when the earth
~~is clad in its adornments and is beautified, and its people think that
~~they have all the powers of disposal over it, Our Command reaches it by
~~night or by day and We make it like a clean-mown harvest, as if it had
~~not flourished yesterday! Thus, do We explain the Ayat (proofs,
~~evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, laws, etc.) in detail
~~for the people who reflect.'' (10:24)
# "And put forward to them the example of the life of this world: it is
~~like the water (rain) which We send down from the sky, and the
~~vegetation of the earth mingles with it, and becomes fresh and green.
~~But (later) it becomes dry and broken pieces, which the winds scatter.
~~And Allah is Able to do everything. Wealth and children are the
~~adornment of the life of this world. But the good righteous deeds that
~~last, are better with your Rubb for rewards and better in respect of
~~hope.'' (18:45,46)
# "Know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and
~~mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and
~~children. (It is) as the likeness of vegetation after rain, thereof the
~~growth is pleasing to the tiller; afterwards it dries up and you see it
~~turning yellow; then it becomes straw. But in the Hereafter (there is) a
~~severe torment (for the disbelievers-evildoers), and (there is)
~~forgiveness from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure (for the believers-
~~gooddoers). And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment".
~~(57:20).
# "Beautified for men is the love of things they covet; women, children,
~~much of gold and silver (wealth), branded beautiful horses, cattle and
~~well-tilled land. This is the pleasure of the present world's life; but
~~Allah has the excellent return (Jannah with flowing rivers) with Him.''
~~(3:14).
# "O mankind! Verily, the Promise of Allah is true. So let not this
~~present life deceive you, and let not the chief deceiver (Satan) deceive
~~you about Allah.'' (35:5).
# "The mutual rivalry (for piling up of worldly things) diverts you.
~~Until you visit the graves (i.e., till you die). Nay! You shall come to
~~know! Again nay! You shall come to know! Nay! If you knew with a sure
~~knowledge (the end result of piling up, you would not have been occupied
~~yourselves in worldly things)". (102:1-5).

# 457. `Amr bin `Auf Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) sent Abu `Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah (May Allah be
~~pleased with him) to Bahrain to collect (Jizyah). So he returned from
~~Bahrain with wealth. The Ansar got news of it and joined with the
~~Prophet (PBUH) in the Fajr prayer. When the Prophet (PBUH) concluded the
~~prayer, they stood in his way. When he saw them, he smiled and said, "I
~~think you have heard about the arrival of Abu `Ubaidah with something
~~from Bahrain". They said, "Yes! O Messenger of Allah!". He (PBUH) said,
~~"Rejoice and hope for that which will please you. By Allah, it is not
~~poverty that I fear for you, but I fear that this world will be opened
~~up with its wealth for you as it was opened to those before you; and you
~~vie with one another over it as they did and eventually it will ruin you
~~as it ruined them".
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: We learn from this Hadith that, from the religious angle,
~~poverty of an individual or nation is not as dangerous as its affluence.
~~For this reason, the Prophet (PBUH) cautioned his Ummah against the
~~consequences of abundance of wealth and warned his followers to save
~~themselves from its evils. We witness today that all his fears have come
~~true. The excess of wealth has made the majority of rich extremely
~~careless about their religious obligations. It is this negligence and
~~evasion from religion about which the Prophet (PBUH) had expressed grave fear.

~~said: "O Allah, there is no true life but the life of the Hereafter".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: The saying of the Prophet (PBUH) quoted in this Hadith
~~relates to two different occasions.
# Firstly, to the Ghazwah of Al-Khandaq (the battle of the Trench) when
~~Muslims were engaged in digging the trench under very difficult
~~circumstances. It was intended to impress upon them the need for
~~patience and boost their morale. They were made to understand that they
~~should not be perplexed by the strenuous period they were passing
~~through because these were transitory and temporary phases of life after
~~which lay the everlasting life, the real life that was not only
~~permanent but also full of perpetual luxuries.
# Secondly, to the occasion of Hajjat-ul-Wada` (last Hajj performed by
~~the Prophet (PBUH)) when he saw around him a large crowd of Muslims.
~~Then he warned them against becoming proud or overjoyed by their
~~strength and power. The grandeur and majesty being witnessed by them
~~would come to an end. The real life was of Al-'akhirah (Hereafter) and
~~they should do their utmost to reform it.

# 461. Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) said: "Three (things) follow a dead person: Members of his
~~family, his property and his deeds. Two of them return; and one remains
~~with him. The people and his wealth return; his deeds remain with him".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith has a warning for the Muslims that they should
~~adopt the way of piety and fear (of Allah), not of sin and impiety
~~because those are actions which will go with him to the grave and which
~~decide his fate in the life after death. If he carries with him good
~~deeds, he will have a comfortable sojourn in Barzakh (the intervening
~~stage between death and Resurrection). On the contrary, if the record of
~~his life is devoid of good deeds, all the wealth that he leaves behind,
~~even if it is beyond calculation, will be of no avail to him because
~~what he will be having with him will be the bad deeds which he performed
~~during his life. These bad deeds will be a constant source of torture
~~for him during his stay in Barzakh.

### ||| AUTO 462 - وعنه رضي الله عنه قال : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه

~~والله يا رب ويؤتى بأشد الناس بؤسا في الدنيا من أهل الجنة فيصبغ في الجنة

# 462. Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Among the inmates of Hell, a person who
~~had led the most luxurious life in this world will be brought up on the
~~Day of Resurrection and dipped in the Fire and will be asked: `O son of
~~Adam! Did you ever experience any comfort? Did you happen to get any
~~luxury?' He will reply: `By Allah, no, my Rubb.' And then one of the
~~people of Jannah who had experienced extreme misery in the life of this
~~world will be dipped in Jannah. Then he will be asked: `O son of Adam!
~~Did you ever experience any misery? Did you ever encounter difficulty?'
~~He will say: "By Allah, no my Rubb, I neither experienced misery nor
~~passed through hardship".
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith also induces one to work for the life of the
~~Hereafter, as the amenities of this world which one strives hard to
~~attain, and for which one violates the injunctions of Shari`ah, will be
~~forgotten with a glimpse of the Hell-fire. Therefore, the sensible
~~course is that one should adopt a way of life which is full of true
~~faith and good deeds so that one becomes eligible for the eternal
~~blessings and joys of the life of the Hereafter.

~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Truly, the world is more contemptible

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith also shows the futility of this world for

~~little further in the darkness of the night and disappeared from my
~~sight. I heard a loud voice. I said (to myself): "The Messenger of Allah
~~might have met (mishap or an enemy)". I wished I could go after him but
~~I remembered his commanding me to stay till he came back. So I waited
~~for him; and when he came, I made mention of what I had heard. He asked,
~~"Did you hear it?". I said, "Yes". Then he said, "It was Jibril
~~(Gabriel), who came to me and said: `He who dies among your Ummah
~~without having associated anything with Allah (in worship) will enter
~~Jannah.' I said: `Even if he committed illicit sexual intercourse or
~~steals?' He (Jibril) said: `Even if he has committed illicit sexual
~~intercourse or steals".
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: The last portion of this Hadith means that a Muslim,
~~having firm faith in the Oneness of Allah, will go to Jannah even if he
~~has committed major sins in his life. If Allah wills, he will be sent
~~straight to Jannah, or he will be sent there after suffering punishment
~~in Hell for sometime. Some scholars have associated this Hadith with
~~such persons who make repentance at the time when they are close to
~~death and then they do not get time to do good or bad deeds. Almighty
~~Allah will pardon even their major sins without giving them any
~~punishment.
# This Hadith also tells us that it is permissible, rather essential, to
~~reserve some money for the payment of loan because its repayment is far
~~more important than giving (voluntary alms).
# It also mentions the piety of the Prophet (PBUH) and his passion for
~~spending in the way of Allah.

~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: "When one of you looks at someone who is

~~who is inferior to him".
# Commentary: By looking at the worldly goods and riches of others, a
~~person gradually becomes unthankful for the blessings which Allah has
~~bestowed on him. The best remedy for this "disease" is that which has
~~been prescribed by Messenger of Allah (PBUH) in this Hadith. The remedy
~~is that one should look at the people who have lesser worldly goods and
~~riches than one's own. If a person has a small house of his own which
~~can protect him from the harshness of weather, then he has no need to
~~see enviously towards sky-high buildings and palatial houses of others.
~~He should look at the homeless people who spend their nights on
~~footpaths and live in huts which in rain leak like sieve and are swept
~~away by a wave of flood water, etc. But from a religious angle, one
~~should see towards those who are more fearful of Allah and observe their
~~Salat meticulously so that one becomes more fond of obedience of Allah,
~~has a greater fear of Him and devotes more time to prayer and devotion.
~~This dispensation is also given in other Ahadith.

# [Ibn Majah]
# Commentary: "Zuhd'' (ascetism) does not mean renunciation of the world
~~and obligations of life. What it really means is that one should be
~~contented with what he possess and rid himself of greed. Islam neither
~~permits renunciation of the world nor does it condemn genuine struggle
~~to acquire wealth and riches. Therefore, involvement in worldly affairs
~~and struggle for lawful means of livelihood are not against Zuhd. A
~~person who is contented with the lawful means of income is a
~~distinguished person as all his activities are exalted to the level of
~~worship. Similarly, unconcern with the wealth and riches of others and
~~ignoring them is a part of Zuhd and contentment. One additional
~~advantage of it is that such a person wins the love and respect of the
~~people because he who begs people, rather than Allah, has to suffer
~~disgrace and is disliked by the people. The case of begging from Allah
~~is just the opposite. The more a person begs Him, the more pleased He
~~will be with him. In fact, He is displeased if someone does not beg Him.
~~This has been exquisitely stated in an Arabic verse, the meaning of
~~which is:
# "Do not stretch your hands before anyone for your needs, but beg from
~~Him (Allah) whose door is always open".

# Commentary:
# 1. This Hadith shows how much care the Companions of the Prophet
~~(PBUH) exercised in following him. They would even emulate him in

~~It was in fact the result of that extreme love that they had for the

~~me and I responded: "At your service, O Messenger of Allah.'' He said,
~~"Go to the people of As-Suffah and usher them in.'' He Abu Hurairah (May
~~Allah be pleased with him) explained: The people of As-Suffah were
~~guests of Islam; they had no family, no property and no relations. When
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) used to receive something in charity, he would
~~send it to them without taking anything from it. When he received a
~~present, he would send for them and share it with them. On this
~~occasion, I disliked to give them anything. I said to myself: "This
~~meagre quantity of milk will not be enough for all the people of As-
~~Suffah! I am more deserving of it than anyone else. By drinking it I may
~~attain some strength. When they come, he will order me to give it to
~~them. I do not expect that anything will be left for me from this
~~milk.'' As there was no alternative but to obey Allah and His Messenger
~~(PBUH). I went and called them. They came and sought permission which
~~was granted. They took their seats. The Prophet (PBUH) called me and I
~~responded, "At your service, O Messenger of Allah.'' He then said, "Take
~~the milk and give it to them.'' I took the bowl and gave it to one man
~~who drank his fill and returned it to me, and I gave it to the next and
~~he did the same. I went on doing this till the bowl reached Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH). By that time all had taken their fill. He (PBUH) took the
~~bowl, put it on his hand, looked at me, smiled and said, "Abu Hirr.'' I
~~said, "At your service, O Messenger of Allah.'' He said, "Now you and I
~~are left.'' I said, "That is true, O Messenger of Allah.'' He said, "Sit
~~down and drink.'' I drank, but he went on saying, "Drink some more.'' I
~~said, "By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I have no room for it.''
~~He said, "Then give it to me.'' So I gave him the bowl. He praised
~~Allah, uttered the Name of Allah and drank the remainder.
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: First, this Hadith indicates the miracle of the Prophet
~~(PBUH) as well as his love and compassion for Ahlus-Suffah, i.e., those
~~poor people who used to stay at As-Suffah. Second, the Prophet (PBUH)
~~would not accept charity, but only gifts. Third, he would also let
~~others share a gift given to him by somebody. Fourth, as seen in this
~~incident, the leftovers of a Muslim, whether food or drink, is
~~permissible to others to consume. Fifth, to persuade a guest to eat or
~~drink more is commendable. Sixth, to eat or drink to one's fill, without
~~extravagance, is also permissible

~~better for you; and if you retain it, it will be evil for you. You will
~~not be reprimanded for storing what is enough for your need. First of
~~all spend upon those who are your dependents.''
# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: The Muslims have been allowed, rather emphatically told
~~and commanded, to possess as much wealth as could meet their personal
~~and family needs. Yet, they have also been advised to spend the spare
~~money on the needy. Man has been told that it is unwise on his part to
~~be niggardly about money because it spawns unfavourable results in this
~~world as well as in the Hereafter. The concentration of wealth within a
~~few hands freezes its vitality and leads to corruption in society. As
~~for the Hereafter, the result of stinginess will be definitely bad as
~~the Qur'an says:
# "The things which they covetously withheld shall be tied to their
~~necks like a collar on the Day of Resurrection.'' (3:180)
# Some `Ulama' are of the opinion that after the payment of the annual
~~Zakat (poor-due), it is not necessary to spend more. But to be accurate,
~~if somebody pays Zakat and yet retains enough money with him, and there
~~are some needy people also in his knowledge, then he will be bound to
~~spend on them. At-Tirmidhi quoted a Hadith in which Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) said, "Indeed there is a right (for poor) in the wealth in
~~addition to Zakat.''

# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: To have one-day food and to enjoy peace and health is
~~indeed a great blessing. It may be said that one has the same
~~satisfaction which one can have on getting the whole world. And if one
~~lacks peace and health, the treasures of the whole world will be of no
~~use because the heaps of wealth cannot provide peace of mind to one, nor
~~can it make one enjoy sound health. The Hadith also implies an advice to
~~man that instead of running after wealth, he should endeavour to seek
~~patience and contentment which alone can guarantee him peace and
~~satisfaction. Otherwise, he is likely to stake everything on the pursuit
~~of this mirage.

~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) sent us in an expedition under the command of
~~Abu `Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) to intercept a caravan of
~~the Quraish. He provided us with a bag of dates, apart from which he
~~found nothing for us. Abu `Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) gave
~~each of us one date (every day). He (the narrator) was asked: "What did
~~you do with that?'' He said: We sucked that just like a baby and then
~~drank water over that, and it was sufficient for us for the day until
~~night. We beat off leaves with the help of our sticks, then drenched
~~them with water and ate them. We then went to the seaside, when there
~~appeared before us something like a big mound. We came near it and we
~~found that it was a beast called Al-Anbar. Abu 'Ubaidah (May Allah be
~~pleased with him) said: "It is dead (so it useless for us).'' He then
~~said: "No (but it does not matter), we have been sent by Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) in the way of Allah and you are hard-pressed (on account of
~~the scarcity of food), so you can eat that.'' We, three hundred in
~~number, stayed there for a month until we fattened up (having plenty to
~~eat of that fish). He (Jabir) said: I saw how we extracted pitcher after
~~pitcher full of fat from the cavity of its eye, and sliced from it
~~compact piece of meat equal to a bull or almost like a bull. Abu
~~'Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) called thirteen men from us and
~~he made them sit in the cavity of its eye, and he held one of its ribs
~~and raised it erect and then saddled the biggest of the camels we had
~~with us and it passed through it (the arched rib), and we carried large
~~pieces of meat for use in our journey. When we came back to Al-Madinah
~~we went to Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and told him about that, whereupon
~~he said, "That was a sustenance Allah had brought forth for you. Do you
~~have any piece of meat left with you, for us to eat.'' Jabir (May Allah

~~that (meat) and he ate it.
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith also points to the economic pinch from which
~~the Companions suffered in the early phase of Islam. They braved it
~~patiently. Secondly, The blessing came to them in the sense that each
~~one of them was patient enough to live on a single date-fruit and water
~~in twenty-four hours. Thirdly, it emphasizes that according to the
~~circumstances, there is always room for Ijtihad (independent juristic
~~reasoning). First Abu 'Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him)
~~hesitated, but later he established a different opinion on the basis of
~~his Ijtihad and decided to use the body of the giant fish as food.
~~Fourthly, it provides us a proof of the sacrifice of the Companions that
~~Allah miraculously granted them such a huge sea-fish that a group of
~~three hundred people kept eating for one month. Fifthly, it tells us
~~that a sea-carrion is a lawful food as indicated in another Hadith: "The
~~water of the sea and its carrion are both Halal.'' Sixthly, this
~~particular fish, like the whale, is a gigantic phenomenon which is
~~normally about 50 feet long.''

~~520. Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: On the day of the
~~battle of Al-Khandaq (the Trench), we were digging the trench when a
~~very hard boulder came in our way. The Companions went to Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) and told him about it. He said, "I will go down the trench
~~to see it.'' He stood up and it was noticed that he had tied a stone
~~over his stomach due to intense hunger. We had not tasted anything for
~~three days. He took up a spade and struck the hard rock with it and it
~~turned into sand. I sought his permission to go home, (after reaching
~~home I) said to my wife, "I have seen the Prophet (PBUH) in a state that
~~I am unable to endure. Have you got anything in the house?'' She said,
~~"I have a small quantity of barley and a lamb.'' I slaughtered the lamb,
~~ground the barley and put the meat in the cooking pot. Then I went to
~~the Prophet (PBUH). In the meantime the flour had been kneaded and the
~~meat in the pot was nearly cooked. I said to him, "O Messenger of Allah,
~~I have some food, will you come along with one or two Companions?'' He
~~asked, "How many men should go there?'' I told him the number. He said,
~~"It will be better if they are more in number. Tell your wife not to
~~remove the pot from the hearth nor the bread from the oven till I
~~arrive.'' Then he said to the Muhajirun and the Ansar: "Let us go (to
~~eat).'' They all rose (and went with him). I went to my wife and said,
~~"Bless you, the Prophet (PBUH), the Muhajirun, the Ansar and the whole
~~company are coming.'' She said, "Did he (PBUH) ask you?'' I replied in
~~the affirmative. (When they arrived) Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said to
~~his Companions, "Enter, but do not crowd in.'' Then he started breaking
~~up the bread and putting meat on it. He would take from the pot and the
~~oven then would cover them up, approach his Companions and hand it over
~~to them. He would then go back and uncover the pot and the oven. He
~~continued to break up the bread and put meat on it till all had eaten to
~~their fill and still some of the food remained. Then he said to my wife,
~~"Eat from it, and send it as a present, for the people have been
~~afflicted with severe hunger.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Another narration is: Jabir said: When the trench was being dug, I
~~noticed the signs of hunger on the face of the Prophet (PBUH). I
~~returned to my wife and said to her, "Have you got anything in the
~~house? I have seen the signs of severe hunger on the face of Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH).'' She brought out a bag which contained a Sa` (a
~~measure that equals approximately 3kg.) of barley. We had a lamb which
~~was reared in the home. I slaughtered the lamb and she ground the flour
~~for baking bread. I then cut the meat and put it in the cooking pot.
~~When I was returning to Messenger of Allah (PBUH), my wife said to me,
~~"Do not embarass me before Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and his
~~Companions.'' (She said this because she thought that the food would not
~~be enough for everyone, for how can very little food cater for a
~~thousand people?) When I came to him, I said to him in a low tone, "O
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH), we have slaughtered a small lamb and have
~~ground a Sa` of barley. Please accompany me with a few of your
~~Companions.'' Thereupon he (PBUH) announced in a loud voice, "O people
~~of the Trench, Jabir has arranged a feast for you, so all of you are
~~welcome.'' And addressing me he said, "Do not take the pot off the fire,
~~nor bake the kneaded flour till I arrive.'' So I came home and he came
~~ahead of the people. My wife said, "It will be a matter of disgrace for
~~you (because there is not enough food).'' I said, "I did only what you
~~told me.'' She brought out the kneaded flour and Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) spat into it, and invoked the blessing of Allah on it, and then
~~he spat into the cooking pot and invoked the blessing of Allah on it.
~~Then he said, "Call another woman to help bake bread and let her take
~~out from the cooking pot, but do not take it off the fire.'' There were
~~about a thousand guests. All of them ate till they left the food and
~~went off. Our pot still bubbled as before and the dough was being baked
~~as before.
# Commentary: This Hadith throws light on the simple life style which
~~the Prophet (PBUH) and his Companions led. It also throws light on the
~~miracle of the augmentation of food. Besides, it highlights the
~~humbleness of the Prophet (PBUH) that he, side by side with his
~~Companions, also did hard and arduous jobs. Also we are informed that it
~~is preferable to make an offering, particularly to a needy and hungry
~~person.

~~521. Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Abu Talhah (May
~~Allah be pleased with him) said to (to his wife) Umm Sulaim(May Allah be
~~pleased with her), "I noticed some weakness in the voice of Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) and I feel it was due to hunger. Have you got any food?''
~~She said, "Yes.'' So she brought out barley loaves, took off her head
~~covering, in a part of which she wrapped these loaves and then put them
~~beneath my mantle and covered me with a part of it. She then sent me to
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH). I set forth and found Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) sitting in the mosque in the company of some people. I stood near
~~them whereupon Messenger of Allah (PBUH) asked, "Has Abu Talhah sent
~~you?'' I said, "Yes.'' Thereupon he said to those who were with him to
~~get up (and follow him). He went forth and so did I, ahead of them until
~~I came to Abu Talhah and informed him. Abu Talhah said, "O Umm Sulaim,
~~here comes Messenger of Allah (PBUH) along with the people and we do not
~~have enough (food) to feed them.'' She said, "Allah and His Messenger
~~know better.'' Abu Talhah went out (to receive him) until he met
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH), and he came forward along with him until they
~~both (Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased
~~with him) came in. Then Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "O Umm Sulaim,
~~bring forth what you have with you.'' So she brought the bread.
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) commanded that the bread be broken into small
~~pieces and after Umm Sulaim (May Allah be pleased with her) had squeezed
~~clarified butter out of a butter container and made it just like soup.
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) recited over it what Allah wished him to
~~recite. He then said, "Allow ten guests to come in.'' They ate until
~~they had their fill. They then went out. He (Messenger of Allah (PBUH))
~~again said, "Allow ten (more to come in)'', and he (the host) ushered
~~them in. They ate to their fill. Then they went out. He (PBUH) again
~~said, "Allow ten (more),'' until all the people ate to their fill. They
~~were seventy or eighty persons.
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Another narration is: Anas said: When all had eaten, the remaining
~~food was collected. It was as much as there was in the beginning.
# Yet another narration is: Anas said: The groups of ten people ate by
~~turn. After eighty persons had eaten, Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and the
~~family of that house ate, and there was still a quantity left over.
# Another narration is: Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I
~~visited Messenger of Allah (PBUH) one day, and found him sitting in the
~~company of his Companions, with a belt tied over his waist. I asked,
~~"Why has Messenger of Allah (PBUH) tied the belt on his waist?'' I was
~~told, "Due to hunger.'' I went to Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with
~~him) the husband of Umm Sulaim (May Allah be pleased with her) and said,
~~"O father, I have seen Messenger of Allah (PBUH) with a belt tied over
~~his waist. I asked one of his Companions about the reason of it and he
~~said that it was on account of severe hunger.'' Abu Talhah (May Allah be
~~pleased with him) went to my mother and asked, "Have you got anything?''
~~She said, "Yes. I have a piece of bread and some dry dates. Were
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) to come alone, we could feed him his fill, but
~~if he comes along with others, there would not be enough food.'' Anas
~~then narrated the Hadith in full.
# Commentary: This Hadith mentions the same things we have seen in the
~~previous one. Yet, in this latter one, there is an elucidation that the
~~Prophet (PBUH) and the host-family took meal after everybody had taken
~~it. Imam An-Nawawi said: This shows that it is desirable that hosts
~~should take meal after guests have taken it.
# Secondly, Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) addressed Abu Talhah
~~(May Allah be pleased with him) as father and he did so out of respect.
~~Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) was the step-father of Anas
~~(May Allah be pleased with him). His real father was Malik bin An-Nadir
~~and mother was Umm Sulaim (May Allah be pleased with him). She embraced
~~Islam but her husband remained a non-believer. He left his Muslim wife
~~and migrated to Syria where he died. Afterwards she married Abu Talhah
~~(May Allah be pleased with him). Thirdly, the events of ascetic,
~~contented and destitute life as experienced by the Prophet (PBUH) and
~~his Companions are unthinkable today. But these are such facts, reported
~~most authentically, as can be hardly refuted by being labelled as myths.
~~Yet, some scholars say that it was a particular phase of time when there
~~existed a conflict between Islam and paganism. It demanded that Muslims,
~~by being indifferent to the world and its comforts, should be engaged
~~day and night in uprooting disbelief, and paving the way for the
~~predominance of Islam.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: Self-sufficiency means that man lives on whatever he

~~dispensation. He should not desire more than he needs, nor should he
~~keep an eye on the wealth of others.

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: To be contented with the independent subsistence (Kafaf)
~~has been counted a merit by the Prophet (PBUH) because this prevents one
~~from begging of people. The Hadith points out the excellence of those
~~people who remain satisfied with their limited resources and do not beg
~~of people. Similarly, autarky has its own merit because affluence often
~~makes a man proud, whereas penury lowers his image in the eyes of
~~people. Yet adequate livelihood has no room for the pitfalls of the two

# 524. Hakim bin Hizam (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I
~~begged Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and he gave me; I begged him again and
~~he gave me. I begged him again and he gave me and said, "O Hakim, wealth
~~is pleasant and sweet. He who acquires it with self-contentment, it
~~becomes a source of blessing for him; but it is not blessed for him who
~~seeks it out of greed. He is like one who goes on eating but his hunger
~~is not satisfied. The upper hand is better than the lower one.'' I said
~~to him, "O Messenger of Allah, by Him Who sent you with the Truth I will
~~not, after you, ask anyone for anything till I leave this world.'' So
~~Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) would summon Hakim (May Allah
~~be pleased with him) to give his rations, but he would refuse. Then
~~'Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) would call him but he would
~~decline to accept anything. So 'Umar (May Allah be pleased with him)
~~said addressing Muslims: "O Muslims, I ask you to bear testimony that I
~~offer Hakim his share of the booty that Allah has assigned for him but
~~he refuses my offer.'' Thus Hakim did not accept anything from anyone
~~after the death of Messenger of Allah (PBUH), till he died.
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: Man constantly remains engaged in hoarding wealth and
~~there comes no point of termination to this process. Rather, the more he
~~gets it, the more he is overpowered by lust for it till he is carried to
~~the grave. If man gets wealth in a dignified way without being crazy for
~~it, ethics certainly allows him to do so.

~~he distributed them, giving some men and neglecting others. Then, he was
~~informed that those whom he had not given a thing were displeased. On
~~this the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) praised Allah and glorified Him and
~~said, "It is a fact that I give to one and overlook another. The one I
~~ignore is dearer to me than the one I give. I give to those in whose
~~hearts I perceive anxiety; others I leave with the richness and
~~contentment that Allah has put in their hearts. One of them is `Amr bin
~~Taghlib.'' Upon this `Amr bin Taghlib said, "By Allah I shall not accept
~~a herd of red camels in exchange for what the Prophet said (about me).''
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: Whatever voluntary gifts or the spoils of war were brought
~~to Messenger of Allah (PBUH), he divided them out to the Companions. In
~~distribution, he weighed different considerations in his mind and the
~~beneficiaries were categorized into three groups: the needy, the
~~deserving cases and those whose hearts were to be won over. His primary
~~concern, however, was to make donations to only those people about whom
~~he had apprehensions that, if ignored, they would display impatience and
~~weakness. In this way the reliable and contented type of men were
~~intentionally ignored. The superiority of `Amr bin Taghlib (May Allah be
~~pleased with him) is determined by the fact that the Prophet (PBUH)
~~counted him among the latter, and he rightly took it as a great honour
~~for him. Hence, we conclude that a ruler enjoys powers of expediency
~~with regard to doling out from the public treasury. Yet, he is supposed
~~to carry into practice what is implied by piety, integrity and
~~trustworthiness. He must not be subordinate to self interests.

# 553. Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Whenever the
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) was asked a thing by one who is about to
~~accept Islam but he would give it. A man came to the Prophet (PBUH) and
~~he gave him a herd of sheep scattered between two mountains. When he
~~returned to his people, he said to them: "O my people! Embrace Islam
~~because Muhammad gives like one who has no fear of poverty.'' Some
~~people would embrace Islam only for worldly gains, but soon Islam
~~becomes dearer to them than the world with all what it contains.
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: In this Hadith, there is a provision of giving economic
~~aid to converts to win over their hearts so that their loyalty to Islam
~~is firmly established. The result of this sensible policy was that if
~~somebody had embraced Islam for the sake of gaining material gains, this
~~sentiment, in due course of time, would be stripped off from his heart,
~~and finally he would turn into a sincere Muslim. In view of its
~~rationale, Allah has termed the policy of reconciling hearts, to Islam
~~as a Zakat expenditure. In other words, an allocated sum of the Zakat
~~fund can be expended on this head as well. Some scholars argue that it
~~is now no more permissible to spend on this head. But to be accurate,
~~expending out of the Zakat fund on this head is valid for all times. If
~~a measure is adequately taken on an institutional basis to make the
~~hearts of converts incline to Islam, we can witness its benefits even today.

# 554. `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) distributed some wealth and I said to him, "O Messenger of
~~Allah! Do you not think that there are other people who are more

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: Here also, we hear about the same converts who were still
~~ignorant of Islam and the status of Prophethood. Owing to this ignorance
~~and weak faith, they could adopt such attitude as would have been
~~inappropriate or would have caused lack of courtesy towards the Prophet
~~(PBUH). This brought him to giving preference to them with regard to the
~~distribution of offerings so as to guard them against the sway of the
~~weakness referred to. This reflects the Prophet's generosity and his
~~accommodating sense as well as the care which he took to win over the
~~hearts as mentioned earlier. The purpose behind it was to help increase
~~Faith in their hearts and make them rise above mundane interests as
~~sincere Muslims.

~~I was walking with the Prophet (PBUH) on his return from the battle of
~~Hunain, a few bedouins caught hold of him and began to demand their
~~shares. They forced him to a tree and someone snatched away his cloak
~~(which got entangled in that thorny tree). The Prophet (PBUH) said,

~~these trees, I would have distributed them all among you, and you would
~~not have found me a miser, or a liar, or a coward.''
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: This Hadith also throws light on the issue of distribution
~~of charities for winning over hearts; besides, it depicts the sublime
~~morals of the Prophet (PBUH) as to how he tolerated the harshness and
~~discourtesy of bedouins with patience and humbleness. It also reveals
~~that negative attributes like stinginess, falsehood and cowardice should
~~not be attributed to Imam (religious leader).

~~Allah augments the honour of one who forgives; and one who displays

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith has described three facts. First, Sadaqah does
~~not diminish wealth because Allah blesses the rest of it and thus
~~recompenses it. Besides, the loss of wealth of the almsgiver will
~~certainly be rewarded on the Day of Resurrection. Second, man thinks
~~that a conciliatory or forgiving attitude will weaken his position in
~~the eyes of others. He erroneously takes it as his disparagement and
~~insult. However, this Hadith reveals the reality that by this way, Allah
~~(SWT) raises his image and he is not belittled at all, because a
~~forgiving gesture will enhance his esteem in the hearts of people, and
~~in the Hereafter, Divine reward for it will definitely lead to his
~~elevation. Third, if somebody displays affability and humbleness in his
~~behaviour, Allah (SWT) will project his prestige and dignity into the
~~hearts of others or bless him in the Hereafter.

~~(qualities) which I am going to tell you about. Remember them well:
# (1) The wealth of a man will not diminish by Sadaqah (charity).
# (2) Allah augments the honour of a man who endures an oppression
~~patiently.
# (3) He who opens a gate of begging, Allah opens a gate of poverty (or
~~he said a word similar to it).''
# He (PBUH) also said, "Remember well what I am going to tell you: The
~~world is for four kinds of people. (1) One upon whom Allah has bestowed
~~wealth and knowledge and so he fears his Rubb in respect to them, joins
~~the ties of blood relationship and acknowledges the Rights of Allah on
~~him (and fulfills them); this type will have the best position (in
~~Jannah). (2) One upon whom Allah has conferred knowledge but no wealth,
~~and he is sincere in his intention and says: `Had I possessed wealth, I
~~would have acted like so-and-so.' If that is his intention, his reward
~~is the same as that of the other. (3) One whom Allah has given wealth
~~but no knowledge and he squanders his wealth ignorantly, does not fear
~~Allah in respect to it, does not discharge the obligations of kinship
~~and does not acknowledge the Rights of Allah. Such a person will be in
~~the worst position (in the Hereafter). (4) One upon whom Allah has
~~bestowed neither wealth nor knowledge and he says: `Had I possessed
~~wealth, I would have acted like so-and-so (i.e., he would squander his
~~wealth).' If this is his intention, both will have equal sin.''
# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: This Hadith highlights the following points:
# 1. Those who forgive people and pardon them will be granted honour and
~~elevation both in this life and in the Hereafter.
# 2. Those who have sufficient means to live on and still beg of people
~~out of greed, will be afflicted with poverty.
# 3. The Hadith also urges us to acquire religious knowledge, and also
~~the practise of this knowledge along with the intention to please Allah Alone.
# 4. The Hadith also criticizes ignorance of religious teachings and
~~ignorant people, for ignorance can easily lead one to commit forbidden acts.

~~armour contracts and every ring of it sticks to the place where it is
~~(sinks into his flesh). He tries to loosen it but it does not expand.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: The Hadith metaphorically highlights the significance of
~~giving in charity, saying it covers up a man's sins in such way as a
~~full coat of mail, reaching his feet, conceals his whole body. Aside

~~receive Divine blessing and he will be safe from trials and

~~will be made known to people and not concealed from them, and he will
~~remain the target of miseries. We are further told that when a generous
~~man intends to give charity, his chest expands for it and he happily
~~gives vent to his generosity. On the other hand, when a niggardly man
~~intends to spend money in charity, his chest contracts and he withholds
~~his giving hand. To conclude, this Hadith brings good news to generous
~~people, and a warning to misers.

# Commentary: This Hadith, besides the virtue of alms and charity,

# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: First, the Hadith is suggestive of accepting a present
~~because the exchange of presents increases mutual love. Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) said, "Offer presents to each other as these generate
~~mutual love.'' Second, the Prophet (PBUH) would never turn down anyone
~~asking for something. Third, it is permissible to get a thing prepared
~~to meet a future need. Fourth, we are allowed to receive a benediction
~~from the pious ones as the Companions did in case of those things which
~~had touched the blessed body of Messenger of Allah (PBUH). Yet, today
~~the benedictory sanction is being misapplied by people. For example, the
~~washing of graves is erroneously taken to be a sacred act. Whereas,
~~going by the Islamic Law, there is no room for the concretion of a
~~grave, still less of washing it. Rather this act is unclean and
~~sacrilegious. Similarly, we see some half-mad and insane people bereft
~~of the sense of purity and cleanliness. Yet, the masses consider them to
~~be ecstatics and even try to seek benediction from them. As a matter of
~~fact, such lunatics are totally unconscious of the obligations of Islam,
~~rather everything else. But the sanity of a man becomes questionable if
~~he considers them saints. Also there are places where some relics,

~~his right was a boy and on his left were elderly people. He said to the
~~boy, "Would you permit me to give the rest of this drink to these on my

~~handed over the rest of the drink to him.
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: The Shari`ah rule says that in order to distribute
~~something in an assembly of people, a beginning should be made from the
~~right side. In the said incident, Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with
~~them) then a young boy, was sitting on the right side, while the aged
~~people were sitting on the left side. Regard for the age difference
~~demanded that the beginning should have been made from the side of the
~~latter. But the correct way was that the beginning should be made from
~~Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) because he was sitting on
~~the right side. For this reason, the Prophet (PBUH) did not ignore his
~~right of priority due to his young age, rather by seeking his permission
~~he made it clear that priority should be given to a rightful person,
~~irrespective of the fact that he happened to be a child. On the other
~~hand, it was also essential for Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with
~~them) that in view of respect for elders, he should surrender his right.
~~But he faced a more delicate problem. The cup containing the left-over
~~drink of the Prophet (PBUH) had touched his blessed mouth and this fact
~~prompted Ibn `Abbas i(May Allah be pleased with them) to take lead in
~~benefiting from the benediction. He, therefore, preferred the Prophetic
~~benediction to showing respect to the aged. The Hadith throws light on
~~the requisite respect for the aged as well as highlights the
~~significance of receiving blessing from the pious persons. Besides, it
~~proves the right of priority of the rightful person.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith has already been mentioned. Yet, its relevance
~~with this chapter has prompted us to repeat it here. It lays emphasis on
~~two points. First, if Allah gives wealth to a man, his sense of
~~gratitude should be expressed in his spending it in good ways according
~~to the Divine command. Second, if Allah has endowed somebody with
~~knowledge and wisdom, he should be thankful to his Rubb by way of
~~putting it into practice and by imparting it to others. It means one can
~~aspire for knowledge and richness, provided one's motive is to benefit
~~others. Envy is a bad quality which Muslims must shun. In this Hadith,

~~somebody else has or to be like somebody else without these blessings be
~~taken away from the envied person.

~~"Shall I not teach you something whereby you will catch up with those
~~who have preceded you and will get ahead of those who follow you, and no

~~"Surely, O Messenger of Allah.'' He said, "Say: Subhan Allah, and Allahu
~~Akbar, and praise Him (by saying Al-hamdu lillah) thirty-three times at
~~the end of every Salat.'' They returned to him and said: "Our brothers,
~~the possessors of wealth, having heard what we are doing, have started
~~doing the same.'' Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "This is Grace of
~~Allah which He gives to whom He wishes.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: The wording of the Hadith apparently reveals that Subhan
~~Allah "Glory be to Allah'', Al-hamdu lillah "Praise be to Allah'', and
~~Aallhu Akbar "Allah is the Greatest'' should be recited thirty-three
~~times. If each group of words is said eleven times, the total number
~~will become thirty-three. But Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar believes that each
~~formula should be uttered thirty-three times, that is to say, after each
~~prayer "Subhan Allah'', "Al-hamdu lillah'' and "Allahu Akbar'' should be
~~uttered thirty-three times each. But according to some Ahadith, Imam An-
~~Nawawi is of the view that "Allahu Akbar'' should be said thirty-four
~~times and in the end "La ilaha illallahu Wahdahu la sharika Lahu, Lahul-
~~mulku wa Lahul-hamdu, wa Huwa `ala kulli shai'in Qadir'' (none has the
~~right to be worshipped but Allah, He is One; He has no partners; to Him
~~belongs the dominion and all the praise; and He has power over all
~~things) should be recited. Should we recite them together or separately?
~~Al-Qadi `Iyad is of the opinion that it is better to recite them
~~separately, but Imam An-Nawawi is of the view that both ways are
~~correct. In fact, in both ways the number remains the same. Besides, an
~~addition must not be made to the Sunnah of Messenger of Allah (PBUH).
~~Practically we knew that it is necessary to use the prescription of a
~~physician without making any alteration in its elements; otherwise, it
~~will not work properly. Similarly, there are spiritual benefits,
~~blessings and efficacy in the number told by the Prophet (PBUH). Any
~~alteration in it will nullify its blessing and efficacy. (Fath Al-Bari).
# This Hadith reveals how fervently the Companions were inclined towards
~~good and how concerned about surpassing those who were better than them
~~in some forms of good deeds. Indeed, all Muslims are equal with regard
~~to the practice of religious principles. But what gives an edge to the
~~rich over their poor coreligionists are the financial forms of worship,
~~that is, charity and almsgiving, which the latter are unable to do.

~~from the virtuous path. Taking in consideration the turning health and
~~the brief span of life to his account, he is, therefore, apt to gather

~~confront him any moment and render him unable to do good things to his

# 580. Ubayy bin Ka`b (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When
~~one-third of the night would pass, Messenger of Allah (PBUH) would get
~~up and call out, "O people, remember Allah. The Rajifah (i.e., the first
~~Blowing of the Trumpet which will shake the whole universe and thus

# Commentary: The Qur'an exactly corroborates what has been stated in
~~this Hadith. There will be two soundings of the Trumpet. The first will
~~throw the earth and mountains into tremendous convulsions, annihilating
~~all life and disrupting the entire physical structure of the universe.
~~The second - after an indefinite period of time known to Allah Alone -
~~will mark the Resurrection Day and bring forth the whole scenario of the
~~Last Judgement. Messenger of Allah (PBUH) has invited the attention of
~~mankind to the horrendous ordeal awaiting it in the Last Hour. Besides,
~~this Hadith urges the believers to send the maximum greetings to
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH). It also highlights the excellence of such an
~~invocation. The Qur'an itself makes this demand to the believers:
# "Allah sends His Salat (Graces, Honours, Blessings, Mercy) on the
~~Prophet (Muhammad (PBUH)), and also His angels (ask Allah to bless and
~~forgive him). O you who believe! Send your Salat on (ask Allah to bless)

# In another narration Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Whoever wants to

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: The visit to the graves is not only recommendable from a

~~is also compulsory and binding. However, at the dawn of Islam it was
~~forbidden due to the apprehension that the Muslims might relapse into

~~Monotheistic Belief took root in their minds and the apprehension of
~~pagan echoings evaporated, the ban on visiting the graves was lifted.
~~Rather an emphasis was laid on such a visit, so that an overpowering
~~thought of death might penetrate a believer's mind as a deterrent force
~~against the promptings of his animal self. The believers must remember
~~death and remember that they will be dead sooner or later. It has been

# Commentary: The Prophet (PBUH) used to graze the sheep of Makkans for

~~be easier for them to deal with humans and forbear afflictions which

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: Apparently giving in Sadaqah (charity) decreases wealth,

~~Otherwise, he is sure to receive the best recompense in the Hereafter
~~which will make good his loss. Or, Allah blesses the rest of his wealth
~~in such a way that the sense of loss is removed from his mind. As for a
~~lenient and humble attitude, it is sometimes mistaken by man for his
~~humiliation. But Messenger of Allah (PBUH) calls such an impression as

# Commentary: This Hadith also mirrors, apart from the extreme
~~humbleness of the Prophet (PBUH), his affability and consolation for a

~~of Allah (PBUH) finished eating his food, he would lick his three
~~fingers (i.e., the forefinger, the middle finger and the thumb). He
~~(PBUH) said, "If anyone of you drops a morsel, he should remove anything
~~harmful from it and then eat it. He should not leave it for Shaitan.''
~~He commanded us to clean out the dish saying, "You do not know in what
~~portion of your food the blessing lies.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith also stresses humbleness, simplicity and
~~regard for the Blessings of Allah. To be unwilling to pick up a fallen
~~morsel and eat it and to keep from cleaning up the dish is the style of
~~arrogant and wealthy people. It displays disregard for Allah's Blessing.
~~To eat the fallen morsel after cleaning it and to lick up the dish
~~shows, apart from humbleness, regard for the Divine gift. Such an act
~~pleases Allah. In it there is another advantageous aspect. Man never
~~knows which is the blessed portion of food. When one licks up the dish,
~~or even his fingers, picks up the fallen morsel and eats it after
~~cleaning it, nothing will be wasted from the meal. In this way, the
~~blessed portion of meal will automatically come to him and he will not
~~remain deprived of it. Moreover, the Hadith tells us that Allah's
~~Blessing, in whatever small quantity it may be, must not be wasted. Yet
~~unfortunately, as we see today, food is wasted like anything in the
~~feasts and marriage ceremonies. Whereas there are countless people in
~~the world who do not get enough to eat, and there are many areas where
~~people simply starve. May Allah guide us!

# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: This Hadith underlines a Principle of Allah that He never
~~keeps anything in the world on the rise eternally. Every rising star has
~~its eventual decline. Individuals and nations apart, this law of nature

~~annihilation and fall is the fate of everything. Second, lest power and
~~growth should go to man's head, he is warned by being reduced to
~~smallness that there exists a Supreme One Who holds sway over all
~~creatures and can render the powerful weak and helpless. The bedouin

~~عليه وسلم قال : [ احتجت الجنة والنار فقالت النار : في الجبارون
~~والمتكبرون . وقالت الجنة : في ضعفاء الناس ومساكينهم . فقضى الله بينهما :
~~إنك الجنة رحمتي أرحم بك م أشاء وإنك النار عذابي أعذب بك من أشاء ولكليكما

# 615. Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The
~~Prophet (PBUH) said, "There was a dispute between Hell and Jannah, and
~~Hell said: `The haughty and proud are in me.' The Jannah said: `In me
~~are the weak and the humble.' Thereupon Allah, the Exalted, judged
~~between them saying: `You the Jannah are My Mercy, and through you I
~~shall show mercy to those whom I wish.' (And addressing the Hell) He
~~said: `You are My punishment to punish whom I wish amongst My slaves,
~~and each one of you will have its fill.'''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith warns us against haughtiness and pride and
~~urges us to observe modesty and humility. Jannah and Hell - two
~~otherworldly phenomena - have been called as the manifestations of
~~Allah's Mercy and punishment. True, only the Will of Allah prevails
~~everywhere but the decision to send a man either to Jannah or to Hell
~~will not be taken capriciously. Rather set Divine rules will be working
~~behind it. Allah, will place some people in Jannah due to their good
~~deeds; similarly he will place some people in Hell due to their bad
~~deeds. Allah does not wrong anyone.

~~of Allah (PBUH) said, "On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will not look
~~at him who trails his lower garment out of pride.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: Here Allah's refusal to see an arrogant man means the
~~restraint of the flow of His Grace towards him. Instead of Allah's
~~Mercy, His Wrath will smite the arrogant. The garment which man wears to
~~cover the lower half of his body is called Izar in Arabic. Hence
~~pyjamas, trousers, Shalwar and Tahband will be taken as Izar. Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) has emphatically said that Izar should remain above the

~~displays the attitude of the haughty whose grim fate can be seen in this
~~Hadith.

~~will not speak on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, nor
~~look at them, and they will have a painful punishment. These are: An
~~aged man who commits Zina (illicit sexual act), a ruler who lies, and a
~~proud poor person.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: Here "will not speak'' means He will not say something
~~which will please them, not to talk happily and willingly. Adultery is
~~forbidden to everybody, whether young or old. But it is more condemnable
~~if an old man commits it, because to be guilty of such a detestable act
~~in old age shows that the adulterer has become hardened in sin and his
~~heart is free from the fear of Allah. Lying is forbidden to everybody.
~~But it is particularly vicious in case of a king or head of state. Since
~~he possesses all powers and resources, he has little reason to tell a
~~lie. Hence, if in spite of all this he invents a lie, it will betray his
~~vicious mind and lack of God-consciousness. Similarly, all humans are
~~prohibited from giving vent to pride and arrogance. But if a beggar or
~~destitute, who has no reason to claim dignity and superiority, displays
~~arrogance, it will be a convincing proof of his indifference to the fear
~~of Allah and Shari`ah rules. From this point of view, his arrogance is
~~more abominable and disgusting than that of a wealthy man.

~~of Allah (PBUH) said, "Allah, the Exalted, says: `Honour is My Izar and
~~Pride is My Cloak. Whoever vies with Me regarding one of them, shall be
~~tormented.'''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: According to this Hadith, power and superiority (honour),
~~greatness and grandeur are Divine attributes alone. If anybody tries to
~~invest himself with these attributes or claims them, it means that he is
~~audacious enough to claim godhood. Allah says that it is the result of
~~His sheer Grace to a man if he enjoys these qualities in a restricted
~~measure, and he is supposed to be obedient and grateful to Him for that.
~~In no manner does it behave him to trumpet his own grandeur and
~~greatness. If someone out-steps his limits in this regard, he will get
~~himself into Hell. The Hadith is a signal of warning to men that they
~~must not boast of their power and behave arrogantly towards their
~~fellow-humans.

# 623. Sa`b bin Jaththamah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I
~~presented a wild ass to Messenger of Allah (PBUH) as a gift but he
~~returned it to me. When he perceived signs of despair on my face, he
~~said, "I have declined to accept it because I am in the state of
~~Ihram.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: As, in the state of Ihram, hunting is not allowed to a
~~pilgrim; similarly, the meat of the game, killed on his suggestion or
~~instruction, is forbidden to him, too. For this reason, Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) sent back the gift of the wild ass to his Companion. The
~~Hadith further illustrates that if the recipient has any valid excuse
~~for not accepting a gift, he should explain it so that the sender may
~~not feel dejected. It may be mentioned here that some Ahadith allow us
~~to eat the meat of a game killed by others, whereas this Hadith shows it
~~is not permissible. The orthodox `Ulama', however, have attempted to
~~reconcile the two seemingly incompatible sets of Ahadith with each
~~other. According to the first category of Ahadith, a man, not in the
~~state of Ihram who kills a chase and gives a portion of it as a gift to
~~someone who is in Ihram, the gift will be permissible to the latter. As
~~for the second category of Ahadith, the former kills a game for the
~~latter, or on his suggestion, the man in the state of Ihram will be
~~barred from eating it (as mentioned in Fath Al-Bari). Similarly, it will
~~not be lawful if the game is sent alive to the man in the state of Ihram
~~with this intention that he should himself sacrifice it. The Hadith
~~under discussion depicts this very situation. Imam Bukhari, as we know,
~~has consequently adduced from this Hadith that if an unkilled game, like
~~the wild donkey, is sent as a gift to a man in the state of Ihram, he
~~should not accept it

~~asked Messenger of Allah (PBUH) about virtue and sin, and he said,
~~"Virtue is noble behaviour, and sin is that which creates doubt and you
~~do not like people to know about it.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: An important principle enshrined in this Hadith says that
~~courtesy is a virtue, because a refined mind cultivates good habits,
~~performs good deeds, and shuns all that is bad and corrupt. Also, a
~~simple and understandable principle is laid down about sin. Man feels
~~the pricking of conscience over every bad deed and is also afraid of the
~~reproach of fault-finders, provided he has not reached the lowest point
~~of moral depravity. But a seared conscience is least disturbed even by a
~~heinous and deadly sin or by public censure. We can understand it by the
~~example of man's smelling sense. If it is not dead, man can feel a stink
~~and repugnant odour. But a long association with a dung heap robs away
~~one's smelling sense and feeling of refuse.

# Commentary: The most beneficial thing on the Day of Resurrection will

~~he was asked about indulgence which will admit a man to Hell (Fire) and
~~he answered, "The tongue and the genitals.''
# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: This is also a very comprehensive Hadith. Fear of Allah
~~really links up a man to Him, and moral refinement prevents him from
~~falling short of his duties to people. To be sure, adherence to this
~~two-fold practice will cause the entry of a lot of people to Jannah.
~~Many a man, on the other hand, has a long, sharp and dangerous tongue
~~and this causes him to pour out heretic utterances and indulge in
~~backbiting, slandering and abusive and nonsensical talk. All this
~~activity leads to Hell. As for genitals, an unwary and unrestrained
~~attitude incites one to indulge in immoral pursuits. In both these cases
~~countless people will be led into Hell. For this reason it is imperative
~~for everybody to develop Taqwa (consciousness of Allah / fear of Allah )
~~and refined behaviour and shun the wickedness of tongue and genitals so
~~that his life in the Hereafter may not be ruined.

# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: This Hadith brings into light the corollary of faith and
~~complaisant manners. We may put it in this way that the degree of a
~~man's excellent behaviour determines the degree of his faith. Or the
~~sublimity of faith calls for the sublimity of morals. Similarly, a man

# [Abu Dawud].
# Commentary: Withdrawal from one's right in order to end a dispute is a
~~manly act of great merit. Likewise, this Hadith tells us that a man
~~should avoid telling a lie even in a light vein. If he gives great
~~importance to the rules of the Shari`ah (Islamic Law) and the
~~Commandments of Allah and His Prophet (PBUH), he will definitely refrain
~~from telling a lie even in a chat session or just for the sake of joke.
~~Usually, people don't mind if one tells a lie in a jocular mood, rather
~~some will perhaps approve it. Yet, Allah disapproves of even the
~~harmless or trivial form of falsehood and commands His slaves to keep
~~away from it. From all considerations, however, moral excellence carries
~~immense weight. Because no wrong or evil thing can be shunned without
~~it. In other words, moral excellence surpasses all forms of goodness.

### ||| AUTO 640 - وعن أبي يعلى شداد بن أوس رضي الله عنه عن رسول الله
~~صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : [ إن الله كتب الإحسان على كل شيء فإذا قتلتم
~~فأحسنوا القتلة وإذا ذبحتم فأحسنوا الذبحة وليحد أحدكم شفرته وليرح ذبيحته
~~] رواه مسلم
# 640. Abu Ya`la Shaddad bin `Aus (May Allah be pleased with him)
~~reported: Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Verily Allah has prescribed
~~Ihsan (kindness) for everything. So when you kill, you must make the
~~killing in the best manner; when you slaughter, make your slaughter in
~~the best manner. Let one of you sharpen his knife and give ease to his
~~animal (in order to reduce his pain).''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: By killing is meant the killing of a harmful animal, or
~~the killing of a murderer as retribution and the killing of the enemy in
~~the battlefield. All these situations warrant killing but with a stress
~~on moderation, thanks to Islamic teachings. A believer is told not to
~~let his passions of enmity go wild, and even an enemy or a criminal
~~ought not to be put to a torturous death. In the Pre-Islamic Period of
~~Ignorance it was a prevalent practice that the limbs of a victim were
~~mutilated before he was finally killed. Islam has forcefully forbidden
~~this inhuman custom, stating that the victim should be beheaded with the
~~one swing of sword. Similarly, there are specific instructions regarding
~~an animal's slaughter. First, the knife should be sharpened. Second, the
~~animal must not be slaughtered from its nape, because in both ways it
~~will suffer pain. This Shari`ah rule ensures quick death of the animal.
~~In modern Europe, an animal is slaughtered with one stroke of a cutting-
~~machine. Apparently this method seems to be easy and smooth, yet in this
~~way the animal's blood doesn't flow out from its body completely. So the
~~consumption of the meat of such a kill is injurious to human health. Due
~~to this reason, Islam considers the discharge of blood as a prerequisite
~~to Halal (lawful). Certainly, only the Islamic way of slaughtering an
~~animal is more sound, scientific and wholesome.

# 641. `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Whenever the
~~Prophet (PBUH) was given a choice between two matters, he would (always)
~~choose the easier as long as it was not sinful to do so; but if it was
~~sinful he was most strict in avoiding it. He never took revenge upon
~~anybody for his own sake; but when Allah's Legal Bindings were outraged,
~~he would take revenge for Allah's sake.
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: The two things between which Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
~~would make his choice could be religious or worldly. For instance, if he
~~were asked to award one of the two punishments to somebody, he would
~~choose the milder one. And if he had the liberty of choice between two
~~obligations, he would opt for the easier one. Between war and peace he
~~would always go for peace, provided it involved the interest of Islam
~~and Muslims. Moreover, in all matters he used to take the line of least
~~resistance, in case it went without the disobedience of Allah. In this
~~Hadith, a principle has been defined for Muslims in general as well that
~~they are free to take to an easy way but this must not entail a loophole
~~in respect of the Shari`ah. Secondly, the most excellent character of
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) also comes to our view that he never
~~retaliated for personal reasons. His extraordinary concern for the
~~sanctity of Islamic Law is also displayed by the fact that he could
~~never brook the transgression of Allah's limits, and the transgressor
~~was sure to be punished by him. The Prophet's attitude also explains and
~~delimits the sphere of morality that to let the violator of Divine law
~~go scot-free must not be counted as a sign of good manners. Rather it
~~reflects the lack of religious sensibility. Not to take exception to
~~lapses in mundane affairs surely speaks of moral excellence, but we are
~~not allowed to dispense with the evasion of religious rules.

# 643. `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: I asked the
~~Prophet (PBUH) "Have you ever experienced a day harder than the day of
~~the battle of Uhud?'' He replied, "Indeed, I experienced them (dangers)
~~at the hands of your people (i.e., the disbelievers from amongst the
~~Quraish tribe). The hardest treatment I met from them was on the Day of
~~`Aqabah when I went to Ibn `Abd Yalil bin `Abd Kulal (who was one of the
~~chiefs of Ta'if) with the purpose of inviting him to Islam, but he made
~~no response (to my call). So I departed with deep distress. I did not
~~recover until I arrived at Qarn ath-Tha`alib. There, I raised my head
~~and saw a cloud which had cast its shadow on me. I saw in it Jibril
~~(Gabriel) (PBUH) who called me and said: `Indeed, Allah, the Exalted,
~~heard what your people said to you and the response they made to you.
~~And He has sent you the angel in charge of the mountains to order him to
~~do to them what you wish.' Then the angel of the mountains called me,
~~greeted me and said: `O Muhammad, Allah listened to what your people had
~~said to you. I am the angel of the mountains, and my Rubb has sent me to
~~you so that you may give me your orders. (I will carry out your orders).
~~If you wish I will bring together the two mountains that stand opposite
~~to each other at the extremities of Makkah to crush them in between.'''
~~But Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "I rather hope that Allah will raise
~~from among their descendants people as will worship Allah the One, and
~~will not ascribe partners to Him (in worship).''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: In the vicinity of Al-Madinah stands a mountain, called
~~Uhud, where the `Battle of Uhud' took place. It was in this battle that
~~the Prophet's face was wounded, one of his molars was broken and he fell
~~into a pit dug by `Amr Ar-Rahib. Besides, his uncle, Hamzah (May Allah
~~be pleased with him) was martyred and the disbelievers mutilated his
~~body. `Aqabah was a place at Ta'if where Messenger of Allah (PBUH) rode
~~up from Makkah and met the worst experience. Or, it could be that the
~~incident occurred somewhere at Mina where, during the Hajj season, he
~~urged the different clans to accept the message of Islam so as to seek
~~their help to establish the true religion. Qarn Ath-Tha`alib is also the
~~name of a place which is the Miqat (transit-point where pilgrims assume
~~the state of Ihram) of the Najd people.
# This Hadith also reflects the marvellous character of Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) that he never rebuked the ignorant and those who caused him
~~harm, nor did he ever avenge anybody on grounds of personal hostility.
~~Secondly, he would endure all forms of hardships in the way of Allah
~~with patience and endurance. He never became furious over his harassers,
~~rather he prayed for their guidance. No doubt, the Prophetic life-
~~pattern perennially provides inspiration to preachers and religious
~~instructors. The responsibility of preaching is not a bed of roses but a
~~thorny path to tread on. It is not the welcome and applause which is
~~meted out to him, but people's taunts, reproaches and insults are heaped
~~on the preacher. Consequently, patience, self-possession, self-control
~~and tolerance are vital to braving trials and tribulations in the way of Allah.

~~Allah will make Jannah unlawful for him.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].

# A narration in Muslim is: Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "A ruler

~~not enter Jannah with them.''
# Commentary: Here the attention of rulers has been invited to their
~~obligations. They are told that their designation is very important
~~because they are responsible for tackling the problems and affairs of
~~millions of people. If their single-minded devotion, determined efforts
~~and heartfelt feelings of well-wishing will not go to solving these
~~problems, they will be deemed guilty by Allah. Rulers are, therefore,
~~warned, lest power should go to their head and make them unheedful of
~~people's problems, rights and concerns. Instead being fully conscious of
~~their accountability to Allah (SWT) they are apt to make full efforts to
~~provide justice and peace to people. By "forbid from entering Jannah''
~~means they will not enter it with the first successful people until they
~~get punished for their wrongdoings. If however, they were treacherous to
~~their subjects while regarding this injustice lawful, thus disobeying
~~Allah and His Commands, they will stay in Hell forever because this way
~~they have made permissible and lawful what Allah has forbidden.

~~Allah that which is due to you. Allah will call them to account in
~~respect of the subjects whom He had entrusted to them.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: The political conduct of the Prophets means that rulership
~~and government affairs were also assigned to them, that is, both
~~religious and worldly affairs lay in their custody. There was no
~~dichotomy between the two, they formed a single unit. This also
~~characterized the period of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and the short
~~spell that followed it in the history of Islam. This explains why after
~~the death of one Prophet came another Prophet and became his successor.
~~Second, the Hadith also settles the issue of the finality of Prophethood
~~once for all. "No Prophet will succeed me except the caliphs'', said the
~~Prophet (PBUH). In the case of many claimants to caliphate, he also gave
~~a ruling, that is, people should primarily fulfill their allegiance
~~pledged to the first caliph and keep away from caring for another
~~claimant to caliphate. Third, the Prophet (PBUH) focused, on the lapses
~~of rulers but without being suggestive of a rebellion and public
~~demonstrations against them. Instead he teaches us to obey them in the
~~administrative sphere and also to turn to Allah (SWT) and seek His Mercy
~~and Blessing as long as they rule by the Law of Allah.

~~another in archery when an announcer of Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
~~announced that people should gather for Salat. We gathered around the
~~Messenger of Allah and he ((PBUH)) addressed us, saying, "Every Prophet
~~before me was under obligation to guide his followers to what he knew
~~was good for them and to warn the evil thing which he knew. As for this
~~Ummah, it will have sound state and in its early stage of existence; but
~~the last phase of its existence, will be faced with trials and with
~~things you do not recognize. There will be tremendous trials, one after

~~trial arrives the believer will say: `This is going to bring about my
~~destruction.' When this passes, another calamity will approach and he
~~will say: `This surely is going to be my end.' Whosoever wishes to be
~~removed from the Fire (Hell) and admitted to Jannah should die with
~~faith in Allah and the Last Day; and he should treat others as he wishes
~~to be treated. He who swears allegiance to an Imam, he should give him
~~the pledge in ratification and the sincerity of his heart. He should
~~obey him to the best of his capacity. If another man comes forward as a
~~claimant (when one has already been installed), behead the second.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: Here `its early stage' means the period of the Companions,
~~of the Successors (of the Companions), and of the Followers (of the
~~Successors). In another Hadith, it has been called as the best era. In
~~comparison with all the succeeding periods, this period is surpassingly
~~good, peaceful and blessed. Later would emerge, it was prophesized,
~~mischief after mischief, each being worse than the preceding one. Today,
~~everybody sees the truth of this prophecy like the light of day. By
~~predicting the emergence of mischief, Messenger of Allah (PBUH) wanted
~~to warn his followers that they should keep themselves aloof from them.
~~To them he further explained in advance the precautionary measures, that
~~is, to keep faith in Allah, to remain firm-footed in the belief in the
~~Hereafter and to deal with people fairly, attempting to be polite to
~~them at the same time.
# Besides, prophecy has been made about the abundance of the power-
~~hungry people with a remedial note. In the first instance believers are
~~supposed to swear allegiance to the caliph, and by extending their
~~cooperation to him they should kill another claimant to the caliphate
~~because it is only in this way that the unity of the Muslim Ummah can be
~~maintained, free of chaos and discord. Yet, unfortunately, the power-
~~orientated groups have found a plaything in the shape of democracy,
~~turning peace and unity into a legend of the past. What a pity that
~~despite all that they seek stability and progress! Is it the miracle of
~~time or the quirk of the vested interests that has reversed the whole
~~scheme of things? There is little hope of the improvement of the Muslim
~~world's affairs. Indeed, it faces an ironical situation.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: By rulership is meant caliphate or any other rank

~~the advantageous option. As for the expiation of breaking an oath, there
~~are four options: to set free a slave, or to feed an average-quality

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: There are, according to this Hadith, two conditions for
~~putting people in official positions. The first is the relevant talent
~~for the job, a man is put in charge of; and the second is his capacity
~~for discharging responsibilities thereof. For example, a ruler should
~~primarily possess the ability to maintain law and order and to establish
~~justice; and secondly, he should be endowed with sufficient dynamism and
~~vision to cope with new demands and situations. This basic principle
~~applies to every official, whether in the capacity of governor,
~~minister, advisor, financial administrator or a clerk. Apart from the
~~sense of job, ability and integrity, he should be fired with
~~determination with regard to his work. An office is indeed an important

# Commentary: In the recruitment of good and scrupulous aides lies the

# Commentary: The Ansari, who was being lectured by his brother, was

~~cause of secrecy, she refrained from insisting that the secret should be
~~disclosed to her. Rather, she lent support to her son's standpoint and
~~advised him to conceal the secret. To be sure, it is part of moral
~~teaching that we should keep the secrets of friends in our hearts.
~~Unless we receive a go-ahead from a friend, we must not make his secret

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: A prolonged Salat (prayer) by no means implies a disregard
~~of worshipper's constraints. It is indeed forbidden. Rather the Imam is
~~emphatically told to perform a brief and concise Salat because his
~~followers also include, amongst others, the weak, the aged and the sick
~~people. Herein an emphasis is laid on prolonging Salat instead of
~~Khutbah (religious talk). The Friday Khutbah is meant to be brief. It
~~must not be too lengthy in relation to a brief Salat offered heedlessly
~~and in sheer haste. Salat must be offered in all humility and with full
~~attention and concentration of mind. Furthermore, a worshippper ought to
~~maintain a well-paused equilibrium in different postures of its
~~performance. Brevity should be kept in view of Khutbah.

~~have mercy on you).' The people stared at me with disapproving looks. So
~~I said: "May my mother lose me. Why are you staring at me?'' Thereupon,
~~they began to strike their thighs with their hands. When I saw them
~~urging to me to remain silent, I became angry but restrained myself.
~~When Messenger of Allah (PBUH) concluded his Salat. I have never before
~~seen an instructor who gave better instruction than he, may my father
~~and mother be sacrificed for him. He neither remonstrated me, nor beat
~~me, nor abused me. He simply said,"It is not permissible to talk during
~~Salat because it consists of glorifying Allah, declaring His Greatness
~~as well as recitation of the Qur'an,'' or he said words to that
~~effect.'' I said: "O Allah's Messenger, I have but recently accepted
~~Islam, and Allah has favoured us with Islam. There are still some people
~~among us who go to consult soothsayers.'' He said, "Do not consult
~~them.'' Then I said: "There are some of us who are guided by omens.'' He
~~said, "These things which come to their minds. They should not be
~~influenced by them.''
# (Muslim).
# Commentary: This Hadith emphasizes four points. Firstly, as no talk is
~~allowed in Salat (prayer), nobody can utter benedictory words for a
~~sneezer either. Secondly, this Hadith throws light on the Prophet's way
~~of imparting moral instruction to others. He would prudently enlighten
~~ignorant people on Islam, avoiding to express his resentment over their
~~lapses which simply betrayed their lack of knowledge. This has a lesson
~~for `Ulama' and preachers. Thirdly, Muslims are prohibited from
~~consulting soothsayers. Fourthly, belief in bad omens is also
~~prohibited. Divinations and presages were the popular fallacies of Arabs
~~in the pre-Islamic epoch. Islam abolished them. Yet, once again these
~~absurdities have caught the fancy of ignorant Muslims. May Allah guide them!

~~the whole day with him. I came to the mosque and asked about him. The
~~Companions told that he (PBUH) had gone in a certain direction. Abu Musa
~~added: I followed him inquiring until I came to Bi'r Aris (a well in the
~~suburb of Al-Madinah). (There) I sat down at the door till he (PBUH) had
~~relieved himself and performed Wudu'. Then I went to him and saw him
~~sitting on the platform of the well with his shanks uncovered and his
~~legs dangling in the well. I greeted him and returned to the door of the
~~garden, saying to myself, "I will be the doorkeeper of the Messenger of
~~Allah today.'' Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) came and knocked
~~at the door. I said; "Who is that?'' He said: "Abu Bakr.'' I said, "Wait
~~a moment.'' Then I went to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and said, "O
~~Messenger of Allah! Abu Bakr is at the door seeking permission to
~~enter.'' He said, "Admit him and give him the glad tidings of Jannah.''
~~I returned and said to Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him): "You
~~may enter and Messenger of Allah (PBUH) has given you the glad tidings
~~of (entering) Jannah.'' Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) came in
~~and sat down on the right side of Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and
~~suspended his legs into the well and uncovered his shanks, as the
~~Messenger of Allah had done. I returned to the door and sat down. I had
~~left my brother at home while he was performing Wudu' and intending to
~~join me. I said to myself: "If Allah intends good for him (i.e., to be
~~blessed to come at this time and receive the glad tidings of entering
~~Jannah), He will bring him here.'' Someone knocked at the door and I
~~said, "Who is it?'' He said, "Umar bin Al-Khattab.'' I said, "Wait a
~~moment.'' Then I proceeded towards Messenger of Allah (PBUH). I greeted
~~him and said, "Umar is at the door, seeking permission to enter. He
~~said, "Let him in and give him the glad tidings of entering Jannah.'' I
~~went back to `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) and said to him,
~~"Messenger of Allah has given you permission as well as glad tidings of
~~entering Jannah.'' He entered and sat down with Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) on his left side and dangled his feet into the well. I returned
~~to the door and sat down and said to myself: "If Allah intends good for
~~my brother, He will bring him here.'' Someone knocked at the door and I
~~said, "Who is it?'' He said, "Uthman bin `Affan.'' I said, "Wait a
~~moment.'' I went to Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and informed him about his
~~arrival. He said, "Let him in and give him glad tidings of entering
~~Jannah together with a tribulation which he will have to face.'' I came
~~back to him and said, "You may enter; and Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
~~gives you the glad tidings of entering Jannah together with a
~~tribulation that will afflict you.'' He got in and saw that the elevated
~~platform round the well was fully occupied. So he sat on opposite side.
~~Sa`id bin Al-Musaiyab (May Allah be pleased with him) a subnarrator has
~~reported: The order in which they sat down indicated the places of their
~~burial.
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Another narration adds: Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with
~~him) said: The Prophet (PBUH) ordered me to guard the door. When `Uthman
~~was told (about the misfortune) he praised Allah then said: "Allahu
~~Musta`an (His help is to be sought).''
# (The interpretation of Sa`id bin Al-Musaiyab is that the graves of Abu
~~Bakr and `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) are by the side of the
~~Prophet (PBUH), in the same position they took when they sat next to the
~~Prophet (PBUH) while the grave of `Uthman is away from their graves, in
~~the public graveyard of Al-Madinah known as Baqi` Al-Gharqad).
# Commentary: This Hadith brings four points under our consideration.
~~First, in certain cases, a glad tiding is given about the future life.
~~Second, the Prophet (PBUH) himself gave the good news to the first three
~~Rightly-Guided Khulafa' (caliphs) that they would go to Jannah. Now only
~~an inborn wretch can doubt their Faith. Third, the riot foretold by the
~~Prophet (PBUH) with regard to `Uthman (May Allah be pleased with him)
~~took place in the concluding days of his caliphate. Influenced by the
~~wicked and baseless propaganda of a Jew, `Abdullah bin Saba', a splinter
~~group blockaded `Uthman's house and finally put him to death. The
~~incident reveals the Prophet's truthfulness. Fourth, things are also
~~interpreted while one is awake, and the power of intuition is of course
~~the basis of such a state. Yet, a vision is not necessarily commensurate
~~with the external reality in all cases. However, the first two caliphs,
~~as envisioned by Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him),
~~are eternally resting, along with the Prophet (PBUH), in `Aishah's room,
~~while `Uthman (May Allah be pleased with him) is buried in the Al-
~~Madinan graveyard of Baqi` Al-Gharqad.

~~sudden the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) got up and left us. When he was
~~late to return to us we began to worry lest he should meet with trouble
~~in our absence. I was the first to be alarmed and set out in search of
~~him until I came to a garden belonging to Banu-Najjar (a section of the
~~Ansar). I went round it looking for an entrance, but failed to find one.
~~However, I saw a stream of water flowing into the garden from a well
~~outside. I drew myself together like a fox and slinked into the place
~~and reached the Messenger of Allah (PBUH). He said, "Is it Abu
~~Hurairah?'' I replied in the affirmative. He asked, "What is the matter
~~with you?'' I replied, "You were sitting with us and then you left us
~~and delayed for a time. Fearing you had met with some adversities we got
~~alarmed. I was the first to be alarmed. So when I came to this garden, I
~~squeezed myself like a fox and these people are coming behind me.'' He
~~(the Prophet (PBUH)) gave me his sandals and said, "O Abu Hurairah! Take
~~these sandals of mine, and whoever you meet outside this garden
~~testifying that La ilaha illallah (There is no true god except Allah),
~~being assured of it in his heart, give him the glad tidings that he will
~~enter Jannah.'' (Abu Hurairah then narrated the Hadith in full).
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: As explained earlier in detail, a believer will definitely
~~go to Jannah, provided he/she sincerely believes in Allah without
~~associating anyone with His Divinity, either he/she is very likely to be

# 711. Ibn Shumasah reported: We visited `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be
~~pleased with him) when he was in his deathbed. He wept for a long time
~~and turned his face towards the wall. His son said: "O father, did not
~~the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) give you the good news of such and such?
~~Did he not give you glad tidings of such and such?'' Then he (`Amr)
~~turned his face towards us and said: "The best thing which you can count
~~upon is the affirmation that: La ilaha illallah (there is no true god
~~except Allah), and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. I have
~~passed through three phases. I remember when I hated none more than I
~~hated the Messenger of Allah (PBUH), and there was no other desire
~~stronger in me than that of killing him. Had I died in that state, I
~~would have definitely been one of the dwellers of Fire (Hell). When
~~Allah instilled the love for Islam in my heart, I went to Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) and said, `Extend your right hand, so that I pledge
~~allegiance to you.' He (PBUH) stretched out his right hand, but I
~~withdrew my hand. He said, `What is the matter, `Amr?' I said, `I wish
~~to lay down same conditions.' He asked, `What conditions do you wish to
~~put forward?' I replied, `To be granted forgiveness.' He said, `Do you
~~not know that (embracing) Islam wipes out all that has gone before it
~~(previous misdeeds). Verily, emigration wipes out all the previous sins,
~~and the Hajj (pilgrimage) wipes out all the previous sins.' Thereafter,
~~no one was dearer to me than Messenger of Allah (PBUH), and none was
~~more respectable than him in my eyes. So bright was his splendour that I
~~could not gather enough courage to look at his face for any length of
~~time. If I were asked to describe his feature, I would not be able to do
~~so because I have never caught a full glimpse of his face. Had I died in
~~that state I could have hoped to be one of the dwellers of Jannah.
~~Thereafter, we were made responsible for many things and in the light of
~~which I am unable to know what is in store for me. When I die, no
~~mourner, nor fire should accompany my bier. When you bury me, throw the
~~earth gently over me and stand over my grave for the space of time
~~within which a camel is slaughtered and its meat is distributed so that
~~I may enjoy your intimacy, and in your presence ascertain what answer
~~can I give to the Messengers of my Rubb (the angels in grave).''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith tells us about three phases of the life of
~~`Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with him), that is, pre-Islamic
~~period, post-faith period and the governorship period. Of the last one,
~~when he shouldered heavy responsibilities, he feared that he might have
~~committed some lapses and for that he might be subjected to
~~accountability before Allah. The Hadith invites our attention to the
~~following points:
# First, Amr's vehement hostility of pre-faith days was transformed into
~~intense love for the Prophet (PBUH) upon embracing Islam. Second, the
~~greatness of the Prophet (PBUH) was ingrained in the Companions' hearts.
~~Third, the fear of error and the hope of Divine mercy may cause one to
~~shed tears at the moment of death. Fourth, it is desirable on the part
~~of relatives and friends to do something for the comfort of a dying
~~person by giving him the glad tidings of Allah's Mercy. Fifth, Islam
~~wipes out all previous sins, but afterwards, life should be led
~~according to the dictates of true Faith. In the same way the minor sins
~~are pardoned on account of Hijrah, and Hajj, but a sincere repentance
~~with all its conditions is indispensable to the remission of major sins.
~~Sixth, lamentation over a dead body is forbidden. Seventh, one may
~~desirably make a will before death, particularly with regard to the
~~anti-Shari`ah heresies and rites to which the bereaved people are likely
~~to take recourse. Eighth, there is an affirmation of the orthodox belief
~~that Munkir and Nakir (two angels) appear in the grave and question the
~~dead person about his or her religious beliefs. Ninth, to stand over the
~~grave and to pray for the salvation of the dead person is a desirable
~~act, as the dead person enjoys the intimacy and the visit of the
~~righteous to his grave. This Hadith, therefore, recommends believers to
~~pray for the firmness of the dead person.

# 712. Yazid bin Haiyan (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I went
~~along with Husain bin Sabrah and `Amr bin Muslim to Zaid bin Arqam (May
~~Allah be pleased with them) and, as we sat by his side, Husain said to
~~him: "O Zaid, you acquired great merits that you saw Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH), listened to his talk, fought by his side in (different) battles,
~~and offered Salat behind him. You have in fact earned great merits,
~~Zaid! Could you then tell us what you heard from the Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH)?'' He said: "O my cousin! By Allah! I have grown old and have
~~almost spent up my age and I have forgotten some of the things which I
~~remembered in connection with Messenger of Allah (PBUH), so accept what
~~I narrate to you, and what I fail to narrate, do not compel me to
~~narrate that.'' He then said: "One day Messenger of Allah (PBUH) stood
~~up to deliver a Khutbah at a watering place known as Khumm between
~~Makkah and Al-Madinah. He praised Allah, extolled Him and delivered the
~~Khutbah and exhorted (us) and said, `Amma Ba`du (now then)! O people,
~~certainly I am a human being. I am about to receive a messenger (the
~~angel of death) from my Rubb and I, in response to Allah's Call, but I
~~am leaving among you two weighty things: the Book of Allah in which
~~there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah and
~~adhere to it.' He exhorted (us) (to hold fast) to the Book of Allah and
~~then said, `The second are the members of my household, I remind you (of
~~your duties) to the members of my family.'''
# Commentary: The Prophet (PBUH) told his Companions with reference to
~~his human nature that he too could not escape death because it was a
~~grim reality. So he left his example to others with regard to making a
~~will before death. The Hadith points out the desirability of giving good
~~counsel to one's family and friends, exhorting them to observe
~~uprightness and establish Faith, upon parting either for a journey or

~~the sooner or the later of my affairs then turn it away from me, and
~~turn me away from it, and grant me power to do good whatever it may be,
~~and cause me to be contented with it). And let the supplicant specify
~~the object.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]
# Commentary: Literally Istikharah means seeking goodness from Allah
~~through a particular prayer. This Hadith lays emphasis on it and
~~displays its significance. We should, therefore, practise Istikharah
~~regarding every important matter. However, it is imperative only in
~~cases where one is ignorant of good and evil. Yet, with regard to
~~obligatory and indisputable rules, practices of the Prophet (PBUH) and
~~commendable deeds, no Istikharah is allowed. Similarly, commands and
~~prohibitions of the Shari`ah are categorical and nobody is allowed to
~~seek further guidance by performing Istikharah prayer. Moreover, to set
~~aside the example of the Prophet (PBUH) of Istikharah, and to trust
~~astrologers, palmists and soothsayers seeking the knowledge of future
~~events is sheer ignorance and unpardonable error. The knowledge of the
~~Unseen (or Ghaib) is the domain of Allah Alone and man is supposed to
~~seek His Blessings. Only Allah is Omnipotent and humans must turn to Him
~~to seek inspiration and strength, trusting everything to His Care.
# Istikharah prayer can be offered at any time except in the forbidden
~~hours for prayer because the performance of two Rak`ah is a prerequisite
~~to it. Some people think that the right time for it is before going to
~~bed. This is not true. This supplication (Du`a) can be offered even
~~after performing the two Rak`ah of Istikharah prayer, or before Taslim
~~(i.e., saying Assalamu `Alaikum to conclude the prayer) after Tashahhud
~~or in the state of prostration. If somebody does not know this Du`a by
~~heart, he can, after performing the prayer, read it from some
~~prayerbook.

# Commentary: After returning from `Arafat on the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah,

~~the act of throwing pebbles marks an end to the ban on legal
~~concessions. But this permissibility is minor and partial, that is,
~~everything becomes lawful except the physical contact with one's wife.
~~The ban is totally lifted in the wake of the farewell circumambulation
~~of the House of Allah. Secondly, we are told that the ritual shaving of

~~should eat from our side without stretching our hand to the side where

~~will find no where to spend the night and no dinner.' But if he enters
~~without mentioning the Name of Allah, Satan says (to his followers);

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: Herein, we are told that in order to ward off Satan and
~~his followers, we are supposed to remember Allah before entering our
~~house and before beginning to eat. The remembrance of Allah implies
~~those appropriate prayers of the Prophet (PBUH) which have been
~~mentioned in Ahadith. For example, we are instructed to pronounce the

~~the following Prophetic prayer: "Allahumma inni as'aluka khairal-mawliji

~~`al-Allahi rabbina tawakkalna.'' (O Allah! I ask you for what is good of

# 731. Hudhaifah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When we

~~forth our hands towards the food until he (PBUH) would start eating
~~first. Once, we were with him when a little girl rushed in as if someone
~~was impelling her. She was about to lay her hand on the food when the
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) caught her hand. Then a bedouin came in
~~rushing as if someone were pushing him. He (PBUH) caught his hand also
~~and said, "Satan considers that food lawful for himself on which the
~~Name of Allah is not mentioned. He (Satan) brought this girl to make the
~~food lawful through her but I caught her hand. Then he brought the
~~bedouin to make it lawful through him but I caught his hand too. By Him
~~in Whose Hand my soul is, now Satan's hand is in my grasp along with
~~their hands.'' Then he mentioned the Name of Allah and began to eat.
# [Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i].
# Commentary: Here, too, we are told that if we do not pronounce Allah's
~~Name, Satan and his minions will share our meal with us. So prior to
~~eating, we must pronounce the Name of Allah. An incident is related in
~~this Hadith. Once, Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and his Companions were
~~just to start taking their meal when an unknown girl and a bedouin burst
~~upon the scene. Without seeking the formal permission and pronouncing
~~the Name of Allah they hurriedly stretched their hands to eat. Yet,
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) restrained them from doing so. Owing to Divine
~~inspiration, he had seen the hidden hand of the Devil behind their
~~abrupt actions. We have only one way to escape the Devil, that is, on
~~such occasions we should first pronounce the Name of Allah. Second, this
~~Hadith enlightens us on table manners calling for decency and decorum.
~~It will be called an act of sheer indecency to voraciously pounce upon
~~food as is commonly witnessed in feasts and weddings. Indeed, it is the
~~result of deviation from Islamic teachings that many Muslims have grown
~~ignorant of the Prophet's manner of eating. Allah, too, has left them
~~unrestrained in their beast-like hunger.

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith underlines the wisdom behind licking the
~~fingers and the vessel. The eater never knows whether a blessing
~~underlies what has been eaten by him, or the particles sticking to his
~~fingers and vessels contain it. Those particles, therefore, should not
~~be wasted; they should be made part of food by being licked. They may be
~~invested with a blessing and proved more useful for the eater's health
~~and strength. Moreover, by this way he escapes disregarding the Bounty
~~of Allah.

~~up and remove any of the dirt on it and then eat it, and should not
~~leave it for Satan nor should wipe his hand with towel until he has

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith tells us to pick up a fallen morsel and eat it
~~after cleaning the dirt that may have stuck on it. This marks the
~~expression of humility overcoming Satan as well as getting the blessing.
~~Present-day Muslims hardly care for this directive of Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) because they think that this act will bring disgrace and
~~dishonour upon them. To make matters worse, they throw away a large
~~quantity of unconsumed food in street dumps and dunghills and drains.
~~They even deem it necessary to leave over some food in plates and
~~dishes, still less of licking them. What a pity, the Muslim community
~~has gone far away from the teachings and excellent example of their
~~Prophet (PBUH)!

# 752. Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: A Muslim should be perpetually on his guard against
~~satanic insinuations, even at mealtime. He is required to recite the
~~Name of Allah in the very beginning so that he may be immune from
~~satanic participation and mischief. If a man avoids picking up the

~~demanded the drink for himself and, therefore, drunk it first of all.
~~And if the situation is otherwise, the beginning should be made from the
~~right side according to the Sunnah. Neither should the distributor give

~~have never seen anything more graceful than that.
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: On the basis of this Hadith, some argue that red dress is
~~also allowed to men. Imam An-Nawawi seems to hold the same view.
~~However, many `Ulama' believe that the dress of Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) was not all red but had red stripes. They, therefore, maintain
~~that the red clothes which women wear are not permissible to men. Some
~~`Ulama' think that a ruling on this issue will be on condition of space
~~and time. If at some place disbelievers or women are fond of this
~~colour, it will be banned for Muslim men because of its relevance to
~~disbelief and womanishness. Yet, it will be allowed to Muslim men in a
~~contrary situation. Opinions also exist that the indoor wear of red
~~clothes is permissible to men but forbidden in public. To sum up, the
~~red-coloured dress is not itself a taboo with regard to men. A ruling on
~~it will be conditional in accordance with the situation. For example, in
~~the Eastern society the red-coloured dress is usually worn by women and
~~is peculiar to brides on the occasion of wedding. Men are, therefore,
~~banned to wear it. Allah Alone has the true knowledge.

~~following the movement of his (Bilal's) face to the right and to the
~~left when he recited: `Come to the prayer; come to the success.' Then a
~~spear was fixed (as a Sutrah) in front of Messenger of Allah (PBUH) who

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: `Al-Abtah' is the name of a place which is also called the
~~Muhassab valley. Lexically `Al-Abtah' means a sloping ground. Since it
~~was the passage of rainy water owing to its downward slope, it came to
~~be known by this name. Here the Prophet (PBUH) encamped in a tent.
# This Hadith provides for wearing red-coloured clothes as mentioned in

~~"Do not hold in contempt even an insignificant act of goodness, because

~~Hanzaliyyah (May Allah be pleased with him) continued responding till I
~~asked Abud-Darda' (May Allah be pleased with him) not to annoy him.
# Ibn Al-Hanzaliyyah (May Allah be pleased with him) happened to pass by
~~us another day and Abud-Darda' said to him: "Tell us something which
~~will benefit us and will not harm you.'' He said: "The Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) told us, `He who spends to purchase a horse (for Jihad) is
~~like one who extends his hand for spending out of charity without
~~withholding it.'''
# He passed by us another day and Abud-Darda' (May Allah be pleased with
~~him) said to him: "Tell us something which might benefit us, and will
~~not harm you.'' He said: "The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) once said,
~~`Khuraim Al-Usaidi is an excellent man were it not of his long hair and
~~his lower garment which is hanging down.' When Khuraim heard about what
~~the Prophet had said about him, he trimmed his long hair up to his ears
~~with a knife and raised his lower garment half way on his shanks.''
# On another occasion he passed by us and Abud-Darda' (May Allah be
~~pleased with him) said to him: "Tell us something that will benefit us
~~and will not harm you.'' He said that he heard Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
~~say, while coming back from an expedition: "You are returning to your
~~brothers, so set your saddles and clothes in order so that you look tidy
~~and graceful. Allah hates untidiness.''
# [Abu Dawud].
# Commentary: This Hadith talks about six points. First, a war cry
~~expressive of one's chivalrous deeds and designed to intimidate the
~~enemy is permissible. Second, it is not an impeachable act and will be
~~rewarded by Allah if it is done with a good intention. Third, hair
~~should be grown either up to the earlobes or up to the neck-end as was
~~the Prophet's practice. The Prophet (PBUH) disapproved the long hair
~~upon the shoulders. Fourth, on return from a journey, a man is advised
~~to clean up his appearance and dust-covered clothes; due to the fatigue
~~and dust of journey, he may appear untidy and out of shape. With his
~~ruffled hair and run-down face, whether intentional or unintentional, he
~~will perhaps give a depressive impression to his wife and children and
~~other family members to the displeasure of Allah. Fifth, we may
~~sympathetically allude to the minor shortcomings of a person in his
~~absence for the sake of his moral uplifting. This will not be considered
~~as backbiting. Messenger of Allah (PBUH) talked about Khuraim Al-Usaidi
~~(May Allah be pleased with him) in the same spirit. Sixth, indecency
~~which means something ugly and disgraceful is taken here in an untidy
~~and dishevelled sense which is against aesthetic principles.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].

~~(consciousness of Allah/fear of Allah). As for pure silk, Muslim men are
~~totally disallowed to use it. Even the saddle-cloth must not be of silk.

# Commentary: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) has forbidden the use of
~~hide of wild beasts. Explaining the ban by Messenger of Allah (PBUH),
~~some say that even the tanning process cannot wipe out hair from a

~~are used by extravagant and arrogant people, and its use by Muslims may

# 825. Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: Herein, we are told that the space of meeting should be
~~wide enough to accommodate every participant. None should feel the space
~~problem. Good manners disallow a newcomer to get a seat vacated for
~~himself by force, no matter if the occupant is an inferior. Yet, there
~~is nothing undesirable if the latter willingly vacates the seat for a
~~superior. Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) would never agree
~~to availing even a willing offer in this respect. Obviously extreme
~~Taqwa (fear of Allah) and moral scruples lay behind his reluctance to
~~take the place of somebody else. Yet, there are a few exceptions in this
~~regard. For example, if somebody sits in the chair of his teacher, he
~~may be asked to leave it. Also if a man has fixed place in the market to
~~sell his goods, another person will not be justified in occupying it
~~forcibly.

~~اثنين ثم يصلي ما كتب له ثم ينصت إذا تكلم الإمام إلا غفر له ما بينه وبين

# 828. Salman Al-Farisi (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "If a man takes a bath on Friday,
~~purifies himself thoroughly, uses oil and perfume which is available in
~~the house, sets forth for the mosque, does not (forcibly) sit between
~~two persons, offers the prayer that is prescribed for him and listens to
~~the Imam silently, his sins between this Friday and the previous Friday
~~will be forgiven.''
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: This Hadith highlights eight points. First, to take a bath
~~on Friday is a matter of commendation. Some say this bath is
~~commendable, while others think it is necessary. Second, one should take
~~it in the morning or before going to the mosque to offer prayer. Third,
~~on this occasion the use of perfume or hair-cream is preferable. Fourth,
~~there is a mention of good manners. Instead of crossing over the heads
~~of worshippers, one should try to locate an open space and sit there. To
~~thrust oneself between two sitting persons looks awkward. Fifth, entry
~~into the mosque should be followed by the performance of two Rak`ah
~~prayer, even if the Imam is delivering Khutbah (religious talk). Sixth,
~~an attempt should be made to offer voluntary prayer before the Khutbah.
~~Seventh, complete silence should be observed during the Khutbah to the
~~point that one is not allowed to say to the other person: "Keep
~~silent,'' if one does not want to loose reward. Eighth, if a man offers
~~his Friday prayer by observing the said conditions and prerequisites,
~~his week-long sins will be forgiven by Allah. But these are exclusively
~~minor sins including failure in doing one's duty to Allah. As regards
~~major sins, the sinner will not be forgiven by Allah unless he sincerely
~~repents from the sins. Similarly, a man's failure to do his duties
~~towards his fellow-Muslim brothers or sisters, in case he has wronged
~~them in anyway, will not be pardoned unless he is forgiven by them.

# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: A senseless, boisterous talk, not related to the life to
~~come, is unprofitable and warrants deprecation. But since it is a small
~~sin, it may be pardoned if one sincerely repents of it. Yet, it cannot
~~be classified under the head of major sins and human-right violations

# 833. Abu Barzah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Towards the

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: Feeding poor and destitute is an act of goodness, and so

# 846. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The

~~`Go and greet that company of angels who are sitting there - and then
~~listen to what they are going to say in reply to your greetings because

~~replied: `As-Salamu `Alaikum wa Rahmatullah (may you be safe from evil,
~~and Mercy of Allah be upon you).' Thus adding in reply to him: `wa
~~Rahmatullah (and Mercy of Allah)' to his greeting.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: The Islamic form of greeting - As-Salamu `Alaikum (may you

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].

# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: This Hadith tells us about one aspect of the Prophet's
~~excellent manners that he would take due care of showing regard for the
~~sentiments of people. The whole of a gathering is not supposed to hear
~~the Salam of somebody and respond to him. A single person can represent

~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) passed through the mosque one day and there
~~was a group of women (about ten of them) sitting in the mosque. He
~~raised his hand to offer greetings.
# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: To offer As-Salam by the gesture of hand from a distance
~~is forbidden in Islam because it is the way of non-Muslims. However, it
~~is allowed if words are also uttered along with it. Secondly, Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) could greet women because he was sinless and permanently
~~stood under Allah's Protection. Yet, it is not permissible to other men
~~for the fear of provoking temptation. But this Hadith can be carried
~~into effect in case one feels that no temptation and evil will be
~~involved in it. For example, a man can greet aged and respectable women.
~~However, Salam to young women is not allowed as it can give birth to
~~wickedness.

~~the) release of the captive.''
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: Islam calls upon its followers to co-operate with one
~~another in good things. Like the previous Ahadith, this Hadith too,
~~should be viewed in the same context. Herein, believers are enjoined to
~~endeavour for the liberation of a fellow-Muslim who becomes a prisoner
~~of war or is taken captive by disbelievers in any way. This instruction
~~of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) is also meant for the help of that

~~and co-operation to a Muslim suffering a financial difficulty so that he
~~becomes self-sufficient.

# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: Herein, the example of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH)

# 901. `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When a person
~~complained to the Prophet (PBUH) about an ailment or suffered from a
~~sore or a wound, the Prophet (PBUH) would touch the ground with his
~~forefinger and then raise it (Sufyan bin `Uyainah, the narrator,

~~Rabbina' (With the Name of Allah, the dust of our ground mixed with the
~~saliva of some of us would cure our patient with the permission of our
~~Rubb.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: The Prophet (PBUH) would put his forefinger on earth and
~~then mix his spittle with the dust sticking to it. Afterwards, he would
~~put it on the patient's pain-spot or wound and utter the said
~~supplication. This simple act would cure the patient. Some believe that
~~it was peculiar only to the Prophet (PBUH) and was indeed his miracle
~~because the particular dust was of Al-Madinah's soil with the Prophet's
~~spittle being of a unique quality. But Ibn Hajar differs from this view.
~~Spittle and dust, according to him, are simply external means and the
~~curative effect in them comes from Allah Alone. Secondly, we may turn to
~~the pious people to seek their blessings and prayers for the removal of
~~our ailments and troubles, provided the spiritual treatment is bereft of

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: The word "Ya`udu'' (enquired about the patient's health or

# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: The said Hadith testifies that the Prophet (PBUH) and the
~~Companions had certainly `blown over' the patients. There is no doubt
~~about that. Yet, the act of blowing over must be based on the Names and

# [At-Tirmidhu].

# At the hour of death, man should cut off his link with the world and

~~repeatedly wet his right hand with water and passed it over his face.
~~Like all mortals, he too, experienced the agony of the last moments and

# 919. Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) visited Abu Salamah (May Allah be pleased with
~~him) when his eyes were open soon after he died. He closed them (the
~~eyes) for him and said, "When the soul is taken away, the sight follows
~~it.'' Some members of his family began to weep. He (PBUH) said: "Do not
~~supplicate for yourselves anything but good, for the angels say `amin'
~~to what you say.'' Then he pbuh said, "O Allah! Forgive Abu Salamah, raise
~~his rank among those who are rightly-guided and grant him a successor
~~from his descendants who remain behind. Grant him pardon and us, too. O
~~Rubb of the worlds. Make his grave spacious for him and give him light
~~in it.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: When the soul leaves the body, the eyes remain open as if
~~gazing at it. So, the eyes of the dead body should be closed. Secondly,
~~one should avoid uttering any imprecation on such occasions as the
~~angels, present on the occasion, say `Amin' to it. Thirdly, the
~~Prophet's example requires the pious persons to visit a bereaved family.
~~Condoling them, they should invoke supplication and blessing for the
~~departed soul. Besides, they should pray to Allah to bless the bereaved
~~with both spiritual and material gains and multiple goodness.
~~Supplication, as other Ahadith also tell us, is beneficial to the dead
~~person. Condolence and supplication is undoubtedly a confirmed practice
~~of the Prophet (PBUH). We are supposed to follow only what the Prophet
~~(PBUH) did on such occasions, that is to say, to pray for both the
~~departed soul and the bereaved family. This is not confirmed if in any
~~mourning session, the Prophet pbuh ever prayed by raising his hands. But in
~~view of the accepted mode of praying, to raise hands is also allowable.

# 925. Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) visited Sa`d bin `Ubadah during his illness.
~~He was accompanied by `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf, Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas and
~~`Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with them). The Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) began to weep. When his Companions saw this, their tears

~~punish for the shedding of tears or the grief of the heart, but punishes
~~or bestows mercy for the utterances of this (and he pointed to his
~~tongue).''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: Under the stress of grief, man becomes heavy-hearted and
~~tears flow out from his eyes. This is something natural and beyond human
~~control. Rather the outflow of tears results from Divine compassion.
~~This is neither forbidden nor subject to accountability. It is only
~~wailing which is Haram, and is punishable. Yet, man is blessed with
~~Divine mercy if he gives expression to patience and gratefulness by his
~~tongue. Moreover, to mention the merits and excellence of a departed
~~soul is in itself a good thing because others may be stimulated to adopt
~~them. But to recount them by way of wailing is disliked. A Hadith says
~~that a dead person is tormented because of the weeping of his household.
~~Here weeping means lamenting and wailing. Otherwise, to weep is human
~~instinct and no curbs can be put over it. Besides, this warning is meant
~~for such a person who might have been accustomed to wailing during his
~~lifetime. Or he might have left a will to his family for wailing over
~~his death. May be he consciously avoided giving a predeath warning to
~~his kith and kin against wailing. In all the three situations, he will
~~be equally held accountable with his soul being tormented for the
~~wailing of his relatives. In case, he is uninvolved in any of the
~~situations, he will remain free from hellish torments. Instead the
~~wailers will have to bear the brunt of their sin. As the Qur'an says,
~~"No one laden with burdens can bear another's burden.'' (17:15).

# [Al-Hakim].
# Commentary: All the above mentioned supplications are those which were
~~recited by the Prophet (PBUH) in the funeral prayers. It is, therefore,
~~advisable if they are all put together and recited because we are
~~commanded to pray sincerely for a dead body. Another point comes to our
~~knowledge about the funeral prayer, that is to say, it may be said aloud
~~as affirmed by the above mentioned Ahadith because if the Prophet (PBUH)
~~had not offered it aloud, the Companions would not have been able to
~~memorize these supplications. Thirdly, we are uncertain that after

~~(Bid`ah) and must be abolished. We are unauthorized to refer this

~~good deeds. Every one will find it easy to do such deeds (as will lead
~~him to his destined place) for which he has been created.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: The subject of this chapter is exactly related to the
~~Hadith accounting for reasons of giving a sermon speech beside the
~~grave. As the dimension of the world's impermanent nature and a heart-
~~moving scene directly confront a man's eyes on this occasion, any moral
~~exhortation is most likely to touch the heart. Secondly, the good or bad
~~deeds of man during his fixed life span in this world prefigure in
~~Allah's Knowledge, and He has ordained the good or bad end of everybody.
~~But this does not mean that man is simply helpless in doing what Allah
~~has predetermined. Indeed, Allah already knows that such and such a
~~person will adopt the righteous conduct and meet a good end; and such
~~and such a person will take to the mischievous way and consequently meet
~~a bad end. Unless man has access to Allah's Knowledge and the Preserved
~~Tablet (which is impossible), he is not supposed to give up the right
~~conduct by banking upon His Knowledge. When he is totally ignorant of
~~the Sacred Writ on his ultimate end, he has no other choice but to
~~continue endeavouring in good pursuits. Allah has given him the freedom
~~of choice and will subject him to accountability on this count alone.
~~Moreover, it is the Divine principle that He helps everybody do only
~~that type of work - facilitating it to him as well - which is germane to
~~his bent of mind. Then, there is no reason that man should lag behind in
~~embarking upon the virtuous path and not try to seek the Grace of Allah.

# 949. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "When a man dies, his deeds come to an
~~end, except for three: A continuous charity, knowledge by which people
~~derive benefit, pious son who prays for him.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: A thoughtful reflection of this Hadith will reveal that
~~the three things are indeed man's own good deeds which somehow continue
~~to exist even after his death. For example, places like a hospital, a
~~mosque, a religious school and a well built by a man continue to operate
~~like a trust as traces of his activity in earthly life. To quote the
~~Qur'an:
# "And We record that which they send before (them), and their traces
~~[their footsteps and walking on the earth with their legs to the mosques
~~for the five compulsory congregational prayers, Jihad (holy fighting in
~~Allah's Cause) and all other good and evil they did, and that which they
~~leave behind].'' (36:12)
# So long as they exist and people benefit from them, the dead person
~~will keep receiving his due reward. The same is pertinent to the spread
~~of knowledge of Islamic disciplines to people's moral uplift. For
~~instance, if during his lifetime he wrote books based on Qur'an and
~~Hadith, advocated the cause of Islam, instructed lots of pupils in
~~Islamic teachings, it will be counted as an unending activity on his
~~part. To quote a Hadath: "The one who called people to adopt the Right
~~Path will receive reward in the same measure as did those who had the
~~good fortune to follow him.'' Besides, this Hadith tells us that, after
~~his death, man will receive reward by the prayers of his virtuous
~~children, and other Ahadith too confirm it. This clears the issue of
~~sending the fruit of good works to the welfare of a dead person's soul.
~~Charity or the continual charity from the part of a dead person himself,
~~beneficial (religious) knowledge and prayer are acts of Sunnah under
~~this rule. With the exception of these, all other deeds do not benefit
~~the dead. However, if the dead person was under obligation to perform
~~Hajj or had missed obligatory or vowed fasts, his heirs are commanded by
~~the Prophet (PBUH) to observe them on his behalf. Because this is like a
~~debt payable by the dead person and his heirs are under obligation to
~~discharge it for him. Yet, this rule is inapplicable to other forms of
~~physical worship.

~~"Do not pass by these people who are being tormented, without weeping,

~~When the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) passed near Al-Hijr, he said, "Do not

# Al-Barqani added: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) entered an orchid

# [Abu Dawud].
# Commentary: The Prophet (PBUH) must have divulged to the Companion

~~and man-orientated formula of mutual cooperation. It teaches us that
~~what can be spared should be given to those who need it. This obviates
~~the chances of hoarding as well as the concentration of wealth in a few
~~hands. No doubt, it is a moral instruction. But if Muslims, called as a
~~single body, develop a true sense and awareness of it, wonderful results
~~can accrue from it on a large social scale. What is more, the sublimity
~~of man's Faith and moral behaviour stands on it. One who is indifferent
~~to the perfection of Faith and morality may set it aside. But a man who

~~(the Messenger of Allah (PBUH)) the reason for smiling. He (PBUH) said,

~~night unless she is accompanied by a Mahram (husband or any other
~~relative to whom she is prohibited to marry).''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith offers four points. First, it mentions a
~~twenty-four hour journey. `Ulama', therefore, say that the time limit
~~matters little and the real point is the length of distance to be called
~~journey. A woman is not allowed to travel unless she is accompanied by
~~her husband or a Mahram.
# Second, Hajj is obligatory on her provided she has no financial
~~problem. If a woman has no husband or Mahram, Hajj is not obligatory on
~~her. Neither can she go for Hajj with a group of women, whether for Hajj
~~or any other purpose.
# Third, the term Mahram, apart from husband, applies to all of her male
~~siblingss whom she cannot marry; these include the father, the son, the
~~brother, the nephew, the son-in-law and the foster-father. She cannot
~~travel with anybody but with any of these.
# Fourth, when she goes out, she should wear a Jilbab (an outer gown)
~~dress so that no part of her body should be visible. Moreover, perfume
~~must not be used by her, wearing perfume in public by women is
~~tantamount to fornication, nor should the jingling of her ornaments be

# Commentary: Only such people will be elevated who act upon the

~~happen in both this life and the Hereafter.

# Commentary: This Hadith brings out two points. Firstly, the excellence

~~(PBUH), took me by the hand, and when we were about to step out, I
~~reminded him of his promise to teach me the greatest Surah in the
~~Qur'an. He (PBUH) said, "It is `Alhamdu lillahi Rabbil `Alamin (i.e.,
~~Surat Al-Fatihah) which is As-Sab` Al-Mathani (i.e., the seven oft-
~~repeated Ayat) and the Great Qur'an which is given to me.''

# "And indeed, We have bestowed upon you seven of Al-Mathani (the seven
~~repeatedly recited Ayat), (i.e., Surat Al-Fatihah) and the Grand
~~Qur'an.'' (15:87).
# This Hadith is an elaboration of the Quranic Ayah quoted above. The
~~Prophet (PBUH) held that As-Sab` Al-Mathani is Surat Al-Fatihah (the
~~Opening Chapter) because these seven Ayat are recited not only in every
~~Salat but in every Rak`ah of every Salat for the reason that no Salat is
~~valid without the recitation of this Surah, as is evident from the
~~saying of the Prophet (PBUH): "The Salat of that person who has not
~~recited Surat Al-Fatihah is void.'' It has also been regarded as the
~~greatest Surah of the Qur'an as it covers all the objects of the Qur'an
~~and is a condensation of all the subjects which have been discussed in
~~detail in its other Surah. It includes the belief in the Tauhid (the
~~belief in the Oneness of Allah)), the worship of Allah, the Day of
~~Resurrection, promise (of Jannah) and warning (against Hell-fire),

# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: Like men, jinns have also good and bad elements among
~~them. Almighty Allah has endowed them with such power that if they want
~~they can, with the Will of Allah, harm human beings. This is the reason
~~mischievous jinns harm people. Similarly, influence of the evil eye is
~~also true. What it means is that if a person looks at someone with greed
~~and envy, the evil effects of his look will reach the person viewed, and
~~because of that he has to suffer some loss or trouble or accident. For
~~this reason, the Prophet (PBUH) would seek the protection of Allah
~~against the jinns and the evil eye and pray in his own words for it,
~~saying: "I seek Your protection against jinns and evil eyes of the
~~people.'' After the revelation of the Surah Al-Falaq and An-Nas (last

~~stuff. I caught him and said, "I must take you to the Messenger of Allah

~~a pressing need.'' I let him go. When I saw the Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) next morning, he asked me, "O Abu Hurairah! What did your captive
~~do last night?'' I said, "O Messenger of Allah! He complained of a
~~pressing need and a big family. I felt pity for him so I let him go.''
~~He (PBUH) said, "He told you a lie and he will return.'' I was sure,
~~according to the saying of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) that he would
~~return. I waited for him. He sneaked up again and began to steal food-
~~stuff from the Sadaqah. I caught him and said; "I must take you to the
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH).'' He said, "Let go of me, I am a needy man. I
~~have to bear the expenses of a big family. I will not come back.'' So I
~~took pity on him and let him go. I went at dawn to the Messenger of

~~(That man) came again to steal the food-stuff. I arrested him and said,
~~"I must take you to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH), and this is the last
~~of three times. You promised that you would not come again but you
~~did.'' He said, "Let go of me, I shall teach you some words with which
~~Allah may benefit you.'' I asked, "What are those words?'' He replied,
~~"When you go to bed, recite Ayat-ul-Kursi (2:255) for there will be a
~~guardian appointed over you from Allah, and Satan will not be able to
~~approach you till morning.'' So I let him go. Next morning the Messenger

~~answered, "He promised to teach me some words which he claimed will
~~benefit me before Allah. So I let him go.'' The Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) asked, "What are those words that he taught you?'' I said, "He
~~told me: `When you go to bed, recite Ayat-ul-Kursi from the beginning to
~~the end i.e.,[ Allah! none has the right to be worshipped but He, the

~~And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which

~~رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول : [ إذا سمعتم النداء فقولوا مثل ما
~~يقول ثم صلوا علي فإنه من صلى علي صلاة صلى الله عليه بها عشرا ثم سلوا

# 1037. `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As (May Allah be pleased with them)

~~mention because everyone who does so will receive in return ten rewards
~~from Allah. Then beseech Allah to grant me Al-Wasilah, which is a high

~~I will be that man. If any one asks Al-Wasilah for me, it becomes

# [Muslim]
# Commentary: To invoke blessings upon the Prophet (PBUH) means to
~~recite "Allahumma salli `ala Muhammadin, wa `ala ali Muhammadin, kama
~~sallaita `ala Ibrahima wa `ala ali Ibrahima, innaka Hamidun Majid.''
~~Wasilah literally means that mode or method by which one attains his
~~goal, but here it stands for that high rank in Jannah which will be
~~awarded to the Prophet (PBUH). The word Shafa`ah means to beg someone to
~~pardon somebody's faults and shortcomings or to request someone for
~~doing a virtuous deed. In the context of this Hadith, it refers to the
~~privilege of intercession of the Prophet (PBUH) due to which he will
~~request for the forgiveness of such people for whom he will be given

~~prayer, the performance of which is more difficult than the other

~~prayers have been particularly mentioned because of their special
~~importance. It is implied that one who takes special care of these two
~~Salat will not show any laxity in the other ones. He will also be
~~particular in observing the other obligations and Sunnah because it is a
~~must for the salvation that one should do his best to fulfill all the

~~left them while they were performing Salat and we went to them while
~~they were performing Salat.'''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: The angels for the night come at the time of `Asr when the
~~angels for the morning are present. This is how the angels of the two
~~shifts assemble at this time. The angels of the shift of `Asr leave
~~their duty in the morning, and the angels of the morning shift resume
~~their duty when the pious persons are engaged in Fajr prayer. This is
~~how the two groups assemble again at that time. Thus, when the angels
~~come or go, the people who are punctual in their prayer are engaged in
~~Fajr and `Asr. Almighty Allah knows everything but even then He asks the
~~angels about his pious slaves so that the piousness of the believers and
~~their merit and distinction become evident to them.

# [At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud].

~~completely. Thus in spite of the lights, Fajr and `Isha' prayers are the

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith tells us that Salat in congregation is far
~~more in reward than Salat offered alone. In the preceding Hadith it has
~~been held 27 times and in the present, 25 times more rewarding. The
~~reason for this variation offered by some `Ulama' is that at first it
~~was told to the Prophet (PBUH) 25 times and then it was increased to 27
~~and he communicated to his Companions what was revealed to him. Some
~~other scholars have linked it with the form, spirit and concentration of
~~the Salat. The more meticulous one is about its details, the greater
~~will be the reward for it. Another difference of opinion in this respect
~~is regarding the nature of Salat in congregation. How does one become
~~eligible for higher reward? Does he become eligible for it by performing
~~Salat in congregation anywhere, i.e., at home, in business premises, at
~~an open place, in the desert etc., or in that congregation which gathers
~~in a mosque? Some `Ulama' go with the first opinion while others agree
~~with the second. Hafiz Ibn Hajar preferred the second view on the
~~grounds that the words occuring in the text of this Hadith support this view.

~~deemed sinful for doing so), for them such Ahadith refer to the
~~hypocrites who did not come to the mosque for Salat. Some people are of
~~the view that it is Sunnah Mu'akkadah (an established Sunnah, hence

~~would have been punished by the Prophet (PBUH), but we do not find any

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: Islam has strongly condemned the association of men and
~~women and enjoined women to keep away from mixing with men and observe
~~Hijab (veil). The merit and demerit of place, in the rows in prayer,
~~mentioned in this Hadith is with reference to this background because in
~~the days of the Prophet (PBUH) women used to perform Salat in the
~~Prophet's mosque and their rows were at the end of the gathering. There
~~was no gallery nor a separate section for them. Thus, for men the best
~~place for performing Salat in congregation is the first row because it
~~is farthest from women. The best place for women in Salat in
~~congregation is the last row because it is farthest from men. On the
~~contrary, the last row of men was near the first row of women and for
~~this reason it was regarded as the worst one. Every row of the people
~~performing Salat is good but due to the reason just mentioned, the first
~~row of men and the last row of women are more meritorious, while the
~~last row of men and the first row of women have a lesser merit.

# 1085. Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:
~~When the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) perceived a tendency among his
~~Companions to stand in the back rows, he said to them, "Come forward and
~~be close to me and let those who come after you, follow your lead. If
~~people continue to fall behind (i.e., in acquiring virtues), Allah puts

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: In the context of the chapter, this Hadith tells us that
~~the Prophet (PBUH) disliked those who occupied a place in the rear rows
~~in Salat offered in congregation, and exhorted people to find a place in
~~the front rows for the reason that by virtue of that place they could
~~closely observe his manner of offering Salat and emulate him, while
~~people in the rear rows could emulate those who were in front of them.
~~In this connection, he used a sentence which has become very common and
~~can also apply to other matters besides Salat. One should not lag behind
~~in the acquisition of knowledge and practice and in matters of merit and
~~honour because those who lag behind in such matters are also pushed back
~~by Allah, while those who strive hard to acquire merit and honour are
~~helped by Allah and He makes their way convenient.
# This Hadith also stresses the need to stand close to the Imam and has
~~an inducement for excelling each other in virtues.

~~يلونهم ] رواه مسلم
# 1086. Abu Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) used to gently pat our shoulders when we were
~~standing in rows at the time of Salat and say, "Keep (the rows)
~~straight; do not differ from each other lest your hearts should suffer
~~from discord. Let those of you who are mature and prudent be nearer to
~~me, and then those who are next to them.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: "To gently pat our shoulders'' means that he would set
~~their shoulders right to straighten the row. "Do not differ from each
~~other'' here means that they should stand shoulder to shoulder and ankle
~~to ankle in a straight line. The reason is that disorder will have a
~~spiritual effect and will create discord. The latter would eventually
~~result in the domination of enmity. Thus, we learn from this Hadith that
~~the Imam should stress on his followers the importance of setting their
~~rows straight; and if his exhortation fails, he should go to them
~~personally and set their lines in order. We also learn from this Hadith
~~that men known for wisdom, knowledge and piety should stand in the first
~~row and these should be followed by those who come next to them in these

~~towards us and said: "Make your rows straight and stand close together,
~~for I can see you from behind my back.''
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: This Hadith mentions a miracle of the Prophet (PBUH),
~~namely that he could see people standing in the back rows when he was
~~leading the Salat in congregation. But it does not mean that he was
~~always capable of doing so, as is being impressed by certain people. The
~~true position is that it was a miracle which happened with the Will of
~~Allah at the time when the Prophet (PBUH) was leading the Salat in
~~congregation. It must be borne in mind that a miracle happens with the
~~Will of Allah only. It is not at all in the power of the Prophet (PBUH).
~~Had he been capable of working a miracle on his own, he would have shown
~~it at his own pleasure. But no Prophet was ever capable of it, nor was
~~the Prophet (PBUH) an exception to this rule.
# The second point that we learn from this Hadith is that of setting the
~~rows straight, which, in practical terms, means that those who stand up
~~for offering Salat in congregation must stand so close to each other
~~that their shoulders and feet are in touch. The Prophet (PBUH) used the
~~word "Tarassu" to describe this position which means that they should
~~stand like a brick wall, each unit of which is riveted with the other.
~~This is the meaning which the Companions of the Prophet (PBUH)
~~understood from it and this is what they actually practised. Many people
~~nowadays do not stand in Salat shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot.
~~Some people dislike this practice. May Allah grant guidance to the
~~Muslims so that they can offer Salat according to the Sunnah of the
~~Prophet (PBUH).

# Commentary: This Hadith has been mentioned earlier and is repeated
~~here for its being germane to this chapter. "Put your faces in opposite
~~directions'' signifies that "Allah will create enmity in you'', which
~~will create dissension rather than unity, weakness rather than strength
~~and power, and the Muslims will then be overwhelmed with the fear and
~~terror of their enemies. This phrase can also have a literal meaning,
~~that is in consequence of confusion in your ranks, Allah will turn your

# [Abu Dawud].
# Commentary: This Hadith also tells us about the straightening of rows.
~~Here the phrase "be accommodating to your brothers'' means that one must
~~cooperate with him who tries to set the rows in order, and rather than
~~feeling annoyance on his action, one should happily set the rows right
~~according to his instructions.
# This Hadith tells us that leaving gaps in rows amounts to leaving
~~space for Satan to get in them. To join rows means that no space should
~~be left between the two persons who stand in a line. Similarly, a second
~~row should not be started without completing the first one. To break a
~~row means to leave space in it or start the second row without
~~completing the first."Break him and Join him" can be the words of prayer
~~as well as imprecation, for what they mean is "May Allah join him or
~~break him.'' This is a prayer from the Prophet (PBUH) for the person who
~~straightens the rows as well as an imprecation for the one who breaks

# [Abu Dawud].
# Commentary: This Hadith stresses that the rows made for Salat should
~~not only be integrated like a solid wall but be set vertically close to
~~each other also. This means that there should not be much space between
~~the two rows. The maximum space allowed for it is three spans. Space in
~~excess of this is disapproved and takes away the merit of offering Salat
~~in congregation. This formula does not apply to the rows of women
~~because a larger distance between the rows of men and women is more
~~meritorious. (Ibn `Allan).
# "Put your necks in line'' here means to stand shoulder to shoulder - a
~~point which has already been stressed. Viewing Satan secretly entering
~~into the space left in the rows can be correct literally as well as
~~technically. In the former case, it is a miracle of the Prophet (PBUH)
~~while in the latter it is Wahy (Revelation). Almighty Allah informed him
~~that Satan enters the rows of the people offering prayers through the
~~spaces left by them in their rows. Satan is pleased to see these gaps as

~~their total comes to ten Rak`ah while in other Ahadith their total is
~~twelve or fourteen Rak`ah. They are called Sunnah Mu'akkadah or As-
~~Sunnan Ar-Rawatib That is, the Rak`ah which are proved from the saying
~~and practice of the Prophet (PBUH) and which were performed by him
~~usually. These are said to be Compulsory prayers. Secondly, such Nawafil
~~which were not performed by the Prophet (PBUH) regularly. These are

~~said: When the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) used to hear the Adhan (of Fajr
~~prayer) he would perform two supererogatory Rak`ah prayer and would make
~~them short.
# Commentary: "Takhfif'' here means that the Prophet (PBUH) used to
~~shorten the standing, recitation, bowing, prostration, etc., in the two
~~Rak`ah of Fajr prayer because soon after performing them he had to lead
~~the Fajr prayer in which he would prolong his recitation. He would also
~~offer these two Sunnah soon after the daybreak or Adhan, which gives an
~~idea of the preparation he made for them.

~~before the Fajr prayer, concluding each two Rak`ah with Taslim (i.e.,
~~saying As-Salamu `Alaikum) and observing the Witr (odd) at the end. When

~~dawn, he would rise and perform two short Rak`ah, and then would lie
~~down on his right side till the Mu'adhdhin came to (inform) him about
~~Iqamah.
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith tells us that the Prophet (PBUH) was in the
~~habit of lying down on his right side after the two Sunnah of Fajr
~~prayer. It also mentions his offering of Tahajjud prayer, which consists
~~of eleven Rak`ah. He would perform this Salat in the form of four
~~couplets and one Witr. According to some narrations, he would perform
~~four couplets and supplement them with three Rak`ah of Witr. Both these
~~forms are right. This Hadith, also proves the validity of one Witr.
# This Hadith also tells us that the time for the Tahajjud and Witr
~~prayer is from `Isha' prayer to the daybreak. One can perform Tahajjud
~~prayer at any time during this period. But, the best time for it is the
~~third part of the night for the reason that after Tahajjud one can,
~~after a while, perform Fajr prayer in congregation (Jama`ah).
# The Tarawih (optional night prayer) performed in the month of Ramadan
~~is this Tahajjud prayer which is also termed as Qiyam-ul-Lail For the
~~sake of convenience and benefit of congregational prayer, it is offered
~~soon after `Isha' prayer in the month of Ramadan. The right number of
~~Rak`ah in the Tarawih prayer is eight because the Prophet (PBUH) never
~~offered more than eight Rak`ah; with three Witr in the month of Ramadan
~~or otherwise. `Aishah's statement to this effect quoted in Sahih Al-
~~Bukhari also supports this fact. In Hadith literature, the Nawafil of
~~the night have been termed as Qiyam-ul-Lail for which the word
~~"Tahajjud'' has also been used in the Qur'an and Hadith. The word
~~"Tarawih'' does not figure anywhere in Hadith. The word "Tarawih'' for
~~"Qiyam-ul-Lail'' became popular after the era of the Prophet (PBUH) and
~~his Companions. Thus, that number of Tarawih prayer agrees with the
~~Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH) which is proved by the actual practice of
~~the Prophet (PBUH), that is eight Rak`ah and three Witr only. It is not
~~in any case twenty Rak`ah. Authentic Ahadith prove this point
~~abundantly.

~~the Kuffar (infidels) unless Allah has forgiven all his sins for him and
~~would, as a result, save him from Fire altogether. That is, Almighty

~~punishment, his stay in Hell - for a few days or weeks or months

~~Ahadith because he will ultimately be released from Hell and brought to

~~along with him in the enclosure (Maqsurah), and when the Imam concluded

~~said: "Never do again what you have done. When you have observed the

# 1132. `Ali (bin Abu Talib) (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:
~~The Witr prayer is not obligatory as the prescribed Salat (prayers), but
~~the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) observed it as his regular practice

~~(prayer).''
# [At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud].
# Commentary: "Witr'' literally means odd number. "Allah is Witr'' means
~~He is One in Attributes and Actions and has no equal. Witr prayer is
~~also called Witr for the reason that it is performed in one, three, five
~~and seven Rak`ah. It is not permissible to perform it in an even number,
~~like two, four, six, eight etc. Thus, we learn from this Hadith that
~~Witr is not Fard and Wajib but Sunnah Mu'akkadah (compulsory). But it
~~would not be correct to show any slackness in performing them to this
~~reason because every Muslim should do his level best to follow the

# 1140. Abu Dharr (May Allah be pleased with him)reported: The Prophet

~~Praise (i.e., saying Al-hamdu lillah) is an act of charity and every
~~utterance of declaration of His Greatness (i.e., saying La ilaha

~~charity, and forbidding Munkar (evil) is an act of charity, and two
~~Rak`ah Duha prayers which one performs in the forenoon is equal to all
~~this (in reward).''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: "Charity is due from every joint bone" means that when a
~~person gets up in the morning, it is obligatory for him to thank Allah
~~for having every joint of his intact. Therefore, one must praise and
~~glorify Allah. Since a single invocation of the words mentioned in this
~~Hadith is equivalent to one Sadaqah, one must say these words for 360
~~times - a number which equals the number of joints in man's body.
~~Moreover, to enjoin someone to do what is good and dissuade somebody
~~from vice constitutes Sadaqah. However, if one performs two Rak`ah of
~~Duha prayer, it will serve for Sadaqah for all the joints of the body.
~~Thus, this Hadith highlights the merits and importance of Duha prayer.
~~We also learn from this Hadith that Sadaqah is not restricted to

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith holds that Duha prayer consists of eight
~~Rak`ah. Another Hadith elaborates that the Prophet (PBUH) performed
~~these Rak`ah in four couplets. What is the time of Duha prayer? Is Duha
~~prayer and Ishraq prayer one and the same? There is a difference of

~~is soon after sunrise and the last is a little before the sun begins to
~~decline. The one performed in the early hours is called Ishraq prayer,

# Commentary: This Hadith confirms the opinion of those who hold that

~~performed when the sun rises about a lance in the sky while the time for
~~Duha prayer occurs when the hoofs of the animals begin to burn and they

~~Friday prayer; but it is better to take a bath.''
# [Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: This Hadith supports the contention of those who do not
~~hold the Ghusl obligatory for two reasons. Firstly, it allows one to
~~perform Wudu'. In fact, it has been regarded good. Secondly, the Ghusl
~~has been regarded better, from which one can safely infer the permission
~~to leave it. In any case, there is no doubt about its being Masnun
~~(Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH)) and Mustahabb (desirable). The time of
~~the Ghusl is from the daybreak to the time of Salat-ul-Jumu`ah.

# 1154. Salman (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger

~~sins between that Friday and the following Friday will be forgiven.''
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: This Hadith stresses the following four points:
# 1.The need to purify oneself as much as possible on Jumu`ah. One must
~~use hair oil and perfume so that others do not feel any irritation on
~~the bad smell which may rise from one's clothes.
# 2.One is advised to go for Salat-ul-Jumu`ah early so that he has not
~~to jump over the shoulders of others, nor has to sit tightly between two
~~persons. If a person goes to the mosque late, then he should occupy the
~~available seat and observe full manners.
# 3.One should perform Nawafil after reaching the mosque.

~~bath for ceremonial purity, and then goes (to the mosque), he is like
~~one who offers a camel as a sacrifice to seek the Pleasure of Allah; and

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith mentions the merits of going early for Salat-
~~ul-Jumu`ah and narrates inducements provided for it. The earlier a
~~person goes for it, the greater his reward will be. In fact, the reward
~~for it goes on diminishing in proportion to the delay that he makes in
~~reaching the mosque for this purpose so much so that he who reaches the
~~Masjid after the Khutbah, will be totally deprived of the benefits which
~~go with it because his name does not figure in the register which shows
~~men of merits.
# Salat-ul-Jumu`ah is also attended by angels. This fact shows the

~~granted with the condition that what one is asking for is good and

# Commentary: This Hadith brings forth the following three points:
# 1.The auspiciousness of time further enhances the merits of virtuous
~~deeds, as is evident from the stress on reciting more and more
~~salutation on the Prophet (PBUH) on Friday.
# 2.On Jumu`ah, salutation is presented to the Prophet (PBUH). This
~~statement goes to prove that he does not hear salutation of anyone
~~directly, either from near or from far. There is a famous Hadith which
~~says that he hears it from near but this is not "Sahih'' technically.
~~Therefore, the truth of the matter is that he does not hear it directly.
~~It is the angels who convey it to him.
# 3.The most well-worded is "Ibrahimi salutation'' because the Prophet

~~Ibrahima, wa `ala ali Ibrahima, innaka Hamidun Majeed. Allahumma barik

~~we were near `Azwara,' he (PBUH) alighted (from his riding-camel) raised
~~his hands in supplication to Allah for a while and prostrated himself.
~~He remained for a long time in prostration. Then he stood up and raised
~~his hands for a while, after which he prostrated himself (again), and
~~remained for a long time in prostration. Then he stood up and raised his
~~hands for a while, after which he prostrated himself for the third time.
~~Then he (PBUH) said, "I supplicated my Rubb and made intercession for my
~~Ummah, and He granted me one-third of them. So I again prostrated myself
~~in gratitude to my Rubb. Then I raised my head and supplicated my Rubb
~~for my Ummah, and He granted me another third of them. Again I raised my
~~head and supplicated my Rubb for my Ummah and He granted me the last
~~third of them. So I fell into prostration out of gratitude before my
~~Rubb.''
# [Abu Dawud].
# Commentary: The phrase "I supplicated my Rubb and made intercession
~~for my Ummah'' means that the Prophet (PBUH) prayed to Allah to pardon
~~his Ummah and to admit them to Jannah. The interpretation of this Hadith
~~is stated to be that ultimately all the Muslims will be sent to Jannah.
~~They will not abide in Hell for ever. Some of them will go to Jannah
~~after suffering the punishment for their major sins, some through the
~~intercession of the Prophet (PBUH), and some by the Special Grace of
~~Allah. This interpretation is no doubt true. This is confirmed by other
~~Ahadith and forms the belief of the followers of Sunnah of the Prophet
~~(PBUH). But the Hadith under discussion is not "Sahih''. However, Sujud-
~~ush-Shukr (prostrations for thanksgiving), in support of which Imam An-
~~Nawawi has reproduced this Hadith here, is also proved by other Ahadith.
~~To prostrate in gratitude to Allah is correct and permissible . The
~~incident of K`ab bin Malik is included in Sahih Bukhari and Sahih
~~Muslim, which shows that after he came to know that his repentance was
~~accepted, he prostrated to give thanks to Allah. According to the
~~Shafi`i school of thought, the basic elements of Sujud-ush-Shukr (or
~~prostrations to express thanks to Allah) are: (a) the intention (in the
~~heart), (b) the Takbir, (c) prostration and (d) Taslim; the Hanafi
~~school of thought, however, maintain that it is an act of prostration
~~between two Takbir. It is permissible to perform it outside Salat, but
~~not during it because it will invalidate it, if one does so
~~deliberately.

~~follow the practice of the righteous and avoid the way of those who are
~~negligent or become negligent in the performance of virtuous deeds.
~~Urination of Satan in a person's ear or ears can be literally true
~~(although we cannot perceive it) because if a person does not seek the
~~protection of Allah against Satan, then Satan joins him in food and
~~other activities, as is evident from other Ahadith. Therefore, urination
~~of Satan is also possible. Some people think it is a metaphor to the
~~effect that he who does not get up at night for prayer and goes on
~~enjoying his sleep, Satan `closes' his ears until he does not hear the
~~remembrance of Allah. Some others consider it a metaphor for the
~~contempt and insult of Satan. In either case, we learn from this Hadith

~~opportunity to create mischief, and he succeeds in creating obstructions
~~in the worship and obedience of Allah.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: "Tying knots'' can be literal, the way magicians do it in

~~people from the worship of Allah. Some people are of the opinion that it
~~is a metaphor for sleepiness/dozing. In any case, Satan does his level

# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: What this Hadith tells us is that whether it was optional
~~Saum (fasting) or optional Salat (Nawafil) of the night, that is to say
~~Qiyam-ul-Lail, the Prophet (PBUH) did not have a permanent routine for
~~it. Sometimes it so happened that almost the month passed but he did not
~~observe fasting and then a few days before the end of the month he would
~~start fasting. Sometimes, he would fast day after day continuously, and
~~it would appear as if he would continue fasts for the whole month, but
~~he would then suddenly terminate fasts. Similar was the case of
~~Tahajjud. Sometimes, he would perform Tahajjud prayer in the first
~~portion of the night, sometimes in the second, and sometimes in its
~~later portion. Thus, he was found sleeping and performing Salat in every
~~part of the night.

~~Tahajjud prayer, because one gets closer to Allah in a state of

~~Messenger of Allah! Do you sleep before performing the Witr prayer?'' He
~~(PBUH) said, "O `Aishah! My eyes sleep but my heart does not sleep.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1."My heart does not sleep'' signifies that "usually I am not so
~~overwhelmed by sleep that I miss the Salat''. Some people give a
~~different interpretation of this by saying that his Wudu' remained
~~intact as his heart was awake. This is one of the attributes of the
~~Prophet (PBUH). This Hadith stresses on performing Salat with full
~~decorum and concentration because this is the way the Prophet (PBUH) did
~~it. The real beauty of Salat lies in performing it in accordance with
~~the Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH) and with full peace of mind.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: We learn from this Hadith that:
# 1. Qiyam-ul-Lail (Tahajjud prayer) must be fairly long and every
~~constituent of it should be performed with full peace of mind.
# 2. It is permissible to perform Nafl Salat in congregation.
# 3. In case an Imam inordinately lengthens a Salat, it is permissible
~~for his followers to detach themselves from the congregation. But Ibn

# 1175. Hudhaifah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I performed
~~Salat with the Prophet (PBUH) one night, and he started reciting Surat
~~Al-Baqarah. I thought that he would go in Ruku` (bowing posture in
~~Salat) at the end of one hundred Ayat, but he continued (reciting); and
~~I thought that he would perhaps recite (this Surah) in the whole Rak`ah
~~(prayer), but he continued the recitation; I thought he would perhaps
~~bow on completing (this Surah). He (PBUH) then started reciting Surat
~~An-Nisa' which he followed with Surat Al-Imran. He recited leisurely.
~~When he recited an Ayah which mentioned the tasbeeh, he would say Subhan
~~Allah and when he recited the Ayah which tells how the Rubb is to be
~~asked, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) would then ask from Him; and when
~~he (PBUH) recited an Ayah asking one to seek Protection Allah, he would
~~seek Protection of Allah. Then he bowed and said, "Subhana Rabbiyal-Azim
~~(My Rubb the Great is free from imperfection)''; his bowing lasted about
~~the same length of time as his standing, (and then on returning to the
~~standing posture after Ruku`) he would say, "Sami' Allahu liman hamidah,
~~Rabbana lakal-hamd (Allah listens to him who praises Him. Praise be to
~~You, Our Rubb!),'' and he would then stand about the same length of time
~~as he had spent in bowing. He would then prostrate himself and say,
~~"Subhana Rabbiyal-A`la (My Rubb the Supreme is free from
~~imperfection),'' and his prostration lasted nearly the same length of
~~time as his standing (Qiyam).
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith has already been mentioned. In his commentary
~~on Sahih Muslim, Imam An-Nawawi has interpreted the words (occuring in
~~this Hadith) as "I thought he would perhaps recite in the whole
~~Rak`ah.'' Here Rak`ah means complete Salat (two Rak`ah). This
~~interpretation is necessary for the reason that in its absence, the
~~meanings of the next sentence go wrong. Due to this reason, we have kept
~~these meanings in view in our translation. In any case, it furnishes
~~justification for the desirability of long Qiyam (standing in Salat),
~~the desirability of congregation in Nafl Salat, and the maintenance of
~~the correct sequence in the recitation of the Surah of the Qur'an in
~~prayers, which is not accepted by many people.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: Since Islam has strictly forbidden self-affliction to the
~~extent that it has forbidden hardship even in worship, compulsory
~~awakening for Salat at midnight and observing Saum (fasting) for the
~~whole month (except of the month of Ramadan) is disapproved. The model
~~set by the Prophet (PBUH) is the ideal pattern of moderation in this

~~Him earnestly for pardoning one's sins.

# 1188. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) used to urge (the people) to perform (optional
~~Tarawih) prayer at night during the month of Ramadan. He did not order
~~them or make it obligatory on them. He (PBUH) said, "Whosoever performs
~~(optional Tarawih) prayers at night during the month of Ramadan, with
~~Faith and in the hope of receiving Allah's reward, will have his past
~~sins forgiven.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith highlights the following points:
# 1. Qiyam in the month of Ramadan is a much-stressed act and has great
~~importance from the viewpoint of reward and award.
# 2. The sins which are pardoned through it are minor sins because major
~~sins are not forgiven unless one makes sincere repentance and
~~compensates those whom he has wronged.
# 3. That Qiyam during the month of Ramadan was the practice of the
~~Prophet (PBUH). During the course of a Ramadan, he made Qiyam for three
~~nights consecutively, that is, he performed this Nafl Salat in
~~congregation with his Companions. On the fourth night, when his
~~Companions gathered for this purpose he said to them, "I am afraid it
~~will be made obligatory for you.'' So, in spite of their desire to join
~~him in this prayer, he did not lead the Salat that night. How many
~~Rak`ah did he perform in congregation in these three nights is a
~~pertinent question here. According to Ahadith their total comes to
~~eleven; eight Rak`ah and three Witr. Thus the Masnun number of Rak`ah of
~~Qiyam Ramadan is eleven.
# 4. This Nafl Salat has been interpreted in Ahadith as Qiyam Ramadan.
~~Later on they were named Tarawih. Tarawih is the plural of Tarwihah.
~~Since the Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) and the successors to the
~~Companions used to make a lengthy Qiyam in them and they would take rest
~~after performing every four Rak`ah. This is how these came to be named
~~Tarawih (Rest prayer). (Four Rak`ah are called Tarwihah).
# 5. Tarawih are in fact Tahajjud prayers. For the sake of convenience
~~and benefit of the maximum number of people, it is performed in the
~~month of Ramadan soon after `Isha' prayer, along with the latter, which
~~is the early time for Tahajjud prayers.
# 6. That the Tarawih were performed in congregation is established from
~~the conduct of the Prophet (PBUH). He led this Salat on 23rd, 25th and
~~27th of Ramadan. During his caliphate, `Umar (May Allah be pleased with
~~him) started it again and ordered Ubayy bin K`ab and Tamim Ad-Dari to
~~perform them in congregation. He enjoined them to perform eight Rak`ah
~~Tarawih and three Rak`ah Witr. This practice has been going on ever since.
# 7. Some people say that performing Tarawih in congregation is a Bid`ah
~~(innovation in religion) because it was introduced in the reign of `Umar
~~(May Allah be pleased with him). But this is not correct because it is
~~established that the Prophet (PBUH) did not continue it out of fear that
~~it will be made obligatory; otherwise he would have carried on with it.
~~When the fear that this practice be made obligatory was over, `Umar (May
~~Allah be pleased with him) gave it the form of a Nafl prayer and revived
~~the mode of performing it collectively, and thus fulfilled the desire of
~~the Prophet (PBUH). In spite of all these facts, it is still permissible
~~for one to perform Tarawih individually in the late hours of the night.
~~Since ordinary people are not capable of performing it individually, the
~~step taken by `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) is perfectly
~~correct. If this had not been done, the majority of the people will have
~~remained deprived of the blessings and reward of Qiyam-ul-Lail, which
~~would have been a great deprivation indeed.
# 8. Twenty Rak`ah Tarawih is not confirmed from any authentic Hadith,
~~nor its ascription to `Umar i(May Allah be pleased with him)is proved
~~from any reliable Muttasil (connected) Hadith. A claim has been made in
~~a Munqati` (disconnected) narration that in the days of `Umar (May Allah
~~be pleased with him) people used to perform twenty, thirty-six and forty
~~Rak`ah of Tarawih out of which one can at best infer the justification
~~for more than eight Rak`ah Nafl prayer. Even then the Masnun Tarawih
~~will be eight Rak`ah only, and more or less than that will be Ghair-
~~Masnun.
# 9. In Tarawih, that is Qiyam Ramadan, lengthy Qiyam is Masnun, but it
~~must be borne in mind that the Qur'an must be recited according to the
~~principles of `Ilm-ut-Tajwid with clear and distinct voice at a slow
~~pace. Many of the Qurra recite so fast that it is hard for one to
~~understand, let alone concentrate on what is being recited. Such
~~recitation is a means of retribution rather than reward. A new system is
~~now in vogue: According to this fashion, the whole Qur'an is finished
~~within a few days and eight to ten parts of it are recited daily in
~~Tarawih. There are hundreds of thousands people in the audience. After
~~listening the Qur'an for a few days, these people console themselves
~~that they have heard the entire Qur'an in Tarawih and are now free to
~~pay full attention to their business to make the best of the `Eid
~~season. They do not care to know whether the Qari is reciting the Qur'an
~~or something else.

~~nights of Ramadan than the first twenty nights, in the same way as one
~~should do more worship in Ramadan than in the other months.
# 2. One should keep oneself awake for prayer, worship and glorification

~~the moustache, letting the beard grow, using Miswak (tooth-stick),
~~snuffing up water into the nose (in ablution), paring the nails, washing
~~the bases of the finger joints; plucking the underarm hair, removing of
~~the pubic hair and removing impurities with water from the affected part
~~after a call of nature.''
# The subnarrator said: I forgot the tenth but it might possibly be the
~~rinsing of the mouth (in ablution).
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith tells us about ten qualities which are natural
~~to human beings. Some `Ulama' are of the opinion that the tenth quality
~~among them is circumcision. Anyway, the importance of these ten
~~qualities and the stress on them are evident. The first thing among them
~~is the trimming of moustache. This is Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH) and
~~is meant to cut the projected hair on the upper lip.
# 2. In the opinion of `Ulama', keeping the beard is compulsory but its
~~extent is not determined. On the basis of Ibn `Umar's practice, some
~~`Ulama' hold that the size of handful is essential and beyond that
~~cutting is permissible, or according to a weak narration some consider
~~its trimming towards length and breadth quite fair. But this opinion is
~~not correct. In the words of Al-Bukhari and Muslim, the Prophet (PBUH)
~~used five words for it which are (a'fu, aufu, arkhu, arju, waq'iru) and
~~all of them have similar meanings that the beard should be left alone on
~~natural growth. But, for a few exceptional cases, the common injunction
~~in this behalf is that one should keep full beard. One should neither
~~trim it in length and breadth nor make it handful in size. One can,
~~however, bring it to a normal size in case of its wild growth if one
~~fears that it will cause derision and laughter.
# 3,4. The Miswak and the rinsing of mouth, and putting water into the
~~nostrils are necessary for Wudu'. "Istinshaq'' means to draw water with
~~full force in the nostrils as one does for smelling perfume. Except
~~during Saum, Istinshaq is stressed in Wudu'.
# 5. Paring of the nails is also necessary for cleanliness. If this is
~~not done, filthy matter will go to the mouth through the nails. The
~~fashion of keeping long nails, similar to beasts and animals, now in
~~vogue in women as well as men is not only against nature but is also a
~~sign of beastliness and ferocity.
# 6. The washing of the joints of fingers is also necessary for
~~cleanliness.
# 7,8. The removal of the underarm hair and below the naval is an
~~integral part of cleanliness and inordinate delay in it is disliked.
~~According to a Hadith, delay in it beyond forty days is disgusting.
# 9. Cleaning with water after evacuation is a must for purification
~~because one cannot perform Salat without it. It is permissible to use
~~clod or toilet tissue, etc., but such things used for this purpose
~~should be odd in number, i.e., 3,5,7. But it is better to follow this
~~with water, as water is a natural cleanser.
# 10. Circumcision is also an old tradition or practice. According to
~~the general opinion of `Ulama', it is obligatory. Some of them are of
~~the view that it is desirable on the seventh day. It is, however,
~~permissible afterwards.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].

~~Hadd this will be certainly imposed on him, or her, i.e., cutting of
~~hand in case of theft, one hundred stripes or stoning to death in case
~~of fornication, capital punishment in retaliation for murdering an

~~commit a crime which is liable for Hadd but is somehow not detected by

~~said, "Worship Allah, and never associate anything with Him, establish

~~of Ramadan.'' He (the bedouin) said: "By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I
~~will never add anything to these (obligations).'' When he turned his
~~back, the Prophet (PBUH) said, "He who wants to see a man from the
~~dwellers of Jannah, let him look at him (bedouin).''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. The bedouin mentioned in this Hadith was a new Muslim and for this
~~reason the Prophet (PBUH) told him some essential obligations of Islam
~~so that he did not feel over-burdened with exhortation. Imam At-Tabarani
~~said: "This Hadith and its like was addressed to bedouins who were newly
~~-- converted to Islam. The Prophet (PBUH) told them no more than to
~~fulfill the main obligatory acts of Islam so that they would not feel
~~over-burdened, and therefore bored.'' Following the Divine injunctions
~~in a gradual manner is very important. For once the hearts of the newly
~~converted start to open to the understanding of the Divine injuctions,
~~they will automatically start practising the optional and voluntary acts
~~of devotion with a view to gain Allah's reward and pleasure.
# 2. There are two categories of people who have been granted Jannah.
~~First, those who are called Al-`Asharah Al-Mubashsharah. They are ten
~~most distinguished of the Prophet's followers whose entrance into Jannah
~~was foretold by the Prophet (PBUH) himself. Second, some other persons
~~who were given glad tidings of Jannah by the Prophet (PBUH). The bedouin
~~mentioned in this Hadith is a case in point. The Prophet (PBUH) also

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith has already been mentioned and has been
~~repeated here for its relevance to this chapter. Here the phrase "To
~~pledge allegiance to establish Salat'' and "to pay the Zakat'' means
~~acceptance of Islam because these are such important articles of Islam
~~that one cannot think of Islam without them. Allegiance to them is, in
~~other words, allegiance to Islam. It is a pledge which was taken by the
~~Prophet (PBUH) from everyone who embraced Islam. He would also take a
~~pledge for Jihad when there was a need for it. The third pledge is
~~pledge of Khalifah which was taken by Khulafa Ar-Rashidun (the rightly-
~~guided caliphs) and subsequently the Muslim rulers. These are the three
~~pledges which are proved from the rightly-guided Muslims. The oath
~~accepted by mystics and spiritual guides is an innovation of the later
~~times - much after the Khair-ul-Qurun, that is the first three
~~generations of Muslims.

~~Resurrection, sheets of silver and gold would be heated for him in the

~~be repeated during the day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand
~~years. (This would go on) until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah's)
~~slaves, and he will be shown his final abode, either to Jannah or to
~~Hell.'' It was asked, "How about someone who owns camels and does not
~~pay what is due on him (i.e., their Zakat)?'' He (PBUH) replied, "In the
~~same way the owner of camels who does not discharge what is due in
~~respect of them (their due includes their milking on the day when they
~~are taken to water) will be thrown on his face or on his back in a vast
~~desert plain on the Day of Resurrection and they will trample upon him
~~with their hoofs and bite him with their teeth. As often as the first of
~~them passes him, the last of them will be made to return during a day
~~the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years, until Judgement is
~~pronounced among (Allah's) slaves, he will be shown his final abode
~~either to Jannah or to Hell.'' It was (again) asked: "O Messenger of
~~Allah, what about cows (cattle) and sheep?'' He (PBUH) said, "If anyone
~~who possesses cattle and sheep and does not pay what is due on them
~~(i.e., their Zakat); on the Day of Resurrection, he will be thrown on
~~his face in a vast plain desert. He will find none of the animals
~~missing with twisted horns, without horns or with a broken horn, and
~~they will gore him with their horns and trample upon him with their
~~hoofs. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them will
~~be made to return to him during a day the measure whereof will be fifty
~~thousand years, until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah's) slaves;
~~and he will be shown his final abode either to Jannah or to Hell.'' It
~~was asked: "O Messenger of Allah, what about the horses?'' Upon this he
~~(PBUH) said, "The horses are of three types. One, which is a burden for
~~the owner; another which is a shield, and another one which makes its
~~owner entitled to reward. The one for whom these are a burden is the
~~person who rears them for show or for pride or for causing injury to the
~~sentiments of the Muslims. They will be a cause of torment for their
~~owners. The one for whom these are a shield is the person who rears them
~~for the sake of Allah but does not forget the Right of Allah concerning
~~their backs and their necks (i.e., he lets a needy ride on them), and so
~~they are a shield for him. Those which bring reward to the one who rears
~~them in pastures and gardens are the ones that are used in the Cause of
~~Allah (Jihad) by the Muslims. Whatever they eat from the meadows and the
~~gardens will be recorded on his behalf as good deeds so much so that
~~their droppings and urine will be counted for an equal number of good
~~deeds for him. Even when they break their tying rope and every height
~~from which they climb and every hoofprint which they leave will be
~~counted as a good deed on behalf of the owner. When their owner leads
~~them through a stream from which they drink, though he does not intend
~~to quench their thirst, yet Allah would record for him the quantity (of
~~water) of what they would drink on his behalf as good deeds.'' It was
~~asked: "O Messenger of Allah, what about the donkeys?'' Upon this he
~~(PBUH) said, "Nothing has been revealed to me in regard to the donkeys
~~in particular except this one Verse of a comprehensive nature: "So
~~whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant)
~~shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom (or
~~a small ant) shall see it.''' (99: 8,9).
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith tells us that those people who do not pay
~~Zakat on their property will be punished with this same property which
~~will become an anguish for them on the Day of Resurrection.
# The phrase "and he will be shown his final abode, either to Jannah or
~~to Hell'' clearly means that this would happen on the Day of Judgement
~~and the punishment to defaulters would be given before one's entry into
~~Jannah or Hell. If Almighty Allah will consider this punishment
~~sufficient for a Muslim, He will send him to Jannah, otherwise He will
~~consign him to Hell. In case he is a Muslim, he will be ultimately sent
~~to Jannah (after suffering the punishment in Hell) otherwise, he will be
~~sent to Hell, where he will live for ever.
# The phrase "As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them
~~will be made to return'' means that the process will be repeated again
~~and again. Some people say that there is some alteration in the wording
~~of this Hadith. According to them the correct wording is: "When the
~~first camel will have passed, the last in the line will be returned on
~~him''. This wording makes the text more orderly and evident and this is
~~how it occurs in some of the narrations. Allah knows the truth.
# In this Hadith the words "Fi sabilillah'', (for the sake of Allah, or
~~in the Cause of Allah) have been repeated twice in connection with
~~horses. In the first instance these words are used for noble intention.
~~That is to fulfill humanly needs with it so that one does not have to
~~beg them from others. In the second instance these words stand for
~~Jihad. That is one breeds horses to make use of them in Jihad. The
~~breeding of horses with this intention is eligible to reward, while in
~~the former case is a means of covering one's poverty.

# 1215. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Allah the Exalted and Majestic said:
~~`Every act of the son of Adam is for him, except As-Siyam (the fasting)
~~which is (exclusively) for Me, and I will reward him for it.' Fasting is
~~a shield. When anyone of you is observing fast, he should neither
~~indulge in obscene language nor should he raise his voice; and if anyone
~~reviles him or tries to quarrel with him, he should say: `I am fasting.'
~~By Him in Whose Hand the soul of Muhammad is, the breath of one
~~observing Saum is sweeter to Allah than the fragrance of musk. The one
~~who fasts, experiences two joys: he feels pleasure when he breaks the
~~fast. He is joyful by virtue of his fast when he meets his Rubb.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# In a narration by Al-Bukhari, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said,
~~"Allah says: `(The person observing Saum) has abstained from food and
~~drink, and sexual pleasures for My sake; fasting is for Me, and I will
~~bestow its reward. Every good deed has ten times its reward'.''
# In a narration by Muslim, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "The
~~reward of every (good) deed of a person is multiplied from ten to seven
~~hundred times. Allah (SWT) says: `The reward of observing Saum is
~~different from the reward of other good deeds; Saum is for Me, and I
~~Alone will give its reward. The person observing Saum abstains from food
~~and drink only for My sake.' The fasting person has two joyous
~~occasions, one at the time of breaking his fast, and the other at the
~~time of meeting his Rubb. Surely, the breath of one observing Saum is
~~better smelling to Allah than the fragrance of musk.''
# Commentary: "Khuluf'', is the smell that comes from the mouth of
~~person who observes Saum. It results from the thirst and hunger which he
~~has to suffer during the Saum. The Hadith not only tells us the merits
~~of Saum but also brings into focus the true significance of it. Saum is
~~not thus mere abstention from food, drink and sexual intercourse, but
~~also keeping away from all evils and vices and embracing virtues.

~~crescent and terminate it on sighting it (the new moon), but if the sky
~~is cloudy before you, then complete the number (thirty days) of the
~~month.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: The words "Ghabiya'', and "Ghumma'', both have the same
~~meanings, namely clouded sky or sky overcast with clouds, as a result of
~~which the moon is not visible. In that case, the injunction is that
~~thirty days of the month be completed. If the moon of Ramadan is not
~~sighted on the 29th Sha`ban, then its thirty days be completed and
~~Ramadan's Saum be started on the next day. Similarly, if the moon for
~~the month of Shawwal is not sighted on the 29th of Ramadan, thirty days
~~of Saum must be completed before celebrating `Eid-ul-Fitr. This means
~~that the sighting of the moon is necessary for keeping the Saum of
~~Ramadan. Counting by celestial system is not sufficient for this
~~purpose. Moreover, the evidence of reliable witnesses for the crescent
~~of Ramadan and the evidence of two dependable witnesses for the crescent
~~of Shawwal are sufficient. This amount of evidence will fulfill the
~~requirement of sighting the moon. Whether the sighting of the moon at
~~one place is sufficient for another place is controversial and arguments
~~of both the groups of `Ulama', who support and oppose it, are based on
~~this Hadith. The group which contend that the sighting of the moon at
~~one place is valid for another holds that the words "Sumu" and "Aftiru"
~~are addressed to all the Muslims, and for this reason the sighting at
~~one place holds good for another place. The group which holds that the
~~sighting of the moon at one place is not enough for the Muslims of other
~~localities contend that the words are addressed to the people who have
~~actually sighted the moon. The Muslims of the localities of other areas
~~who have not sighted the moon are not addressed by these words. They say
~~that the sighting of the moon goes with each area according to which
~~they will decide about starting of Saum and celebrating `Eid. There is a
~~third group also, which is of the opinion that for such areas which are
~~in close proximity and do not have much difference in the timings of
~~sunrise and sunset, the sighting of the moon at one place holds good for
~~the other. In any case, it is a moderate view, which can be implemented
~~without fear of its being wrong. According to this view, at least in one
~~country the sighting of the moon at one place holds good for all other areas.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: We learn from this Hadith that in the days of the Prophet
~~(PBUH) there used to be two Mu'adhdhin and two Adhan in the morning. The
~~first Adhan was meant to warn the people who were taking the Suhur meals
~~that the time for the Suhur was about to finish and they should make
~~preparation for Fajr prayer. Soon after that there was a second Adhan by
~~another Mu'adhdhin which signified that the time for food was finished

# So far, the question of time between the two Adhan is concerned,

# Another narration is: He (PBUH) observed Saum during the whole month

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: We learn from another Hadith the reason why the Prophet
~~(PBUH) kept greater number of Saum in the month of Sha`ban. He did so
~~because deeds are presented before Allah during this month. For this
~~reason, he liked that when his deeds were presented, he should be
~~observing Saum (Nasa'i on the authority of Usamah (May Allah be pleased

~~ordered to observe Saum in the first fortnight only, and not in the
~~second in order to maintain their energy and vitality for the obligatory
~~Saum (i.e., Ramadan). The Prophet (PBUH) had greater spiritual strength
~~and Saum did not cause him weakness due to this strength. Again, by
~~virtue of this strength he would sometimes even observe Saum which is

# 1249. Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "There are no days during which the
~~righteous action is so pleasing to Allah than these days (i.e., the
~~first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah).'' He was asked: "O Messenger of Allah,

~~and his property and does not return with either of it.''
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: This Hadith brings out the following two points:
# 1. Righteous deeds during the first ten days of the month of Dhul-
~~Hijjah are far better and more rewarding than righteous deeds done on
~~other days of the year, because they are Hajj days in the sacred season
~~of pilgrimage. Because of their excellence and importance, Allah (SWT)
~~swore by them, thus: "By the Dawn; by the ten Nights...'' (89:1,2)
# 2. Jihad has great eminence in Islam.

~~الله عليه وسلم عن صوم يوم عرفة ؟ قال : [ يكفر السنة الماضية والباقية ]

# 1250. Abu Qatadah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) was asked about the observance of Saum
~~(fasting) on the day of `Arafah. He said, "It is an expiation for the
~~sins of the preceding year and the current year.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: The ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah is called Yaum-`Arafah . On
~~this day, pilgrims stop and stand in prayers at `Arafat which is the
~~most important ritual of Hajj, so much so that Hajj is deemed incomplete
~~without it. On that day, the pilgrims are engaged in the remembrance of
~~Allah and prayers as that is their most important worship on that day.
~~For this reason, Saum is not desirable for them, but for other people,
~~Saum has a special merit. The importance and merit of this Saum can be
~~judged from the fact that it expiates sins for two consecutive years:
~~the previous year and the current year. But these sins relate only to
~~the minor sins, not the major ones, or become a means of elevation of
~~one's status.

# 1251. Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) observed Saum (fasting) on the day of `Ashura'
~~and commanded us to fast on this day.
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: `Ashura' 10th of Muharram. In another Hadith, it is stated
~~that when the Prophet (PBUH) emigrated from Makkah to Al-Madinah, he saw
~~that the Jews were fasting on this day. He asked them why they did this
~~on that day, and they told him that they did it for the reason that
~~Allah granted Prophet Musa emancipation from Pharaoh on this day, and so
~~they observed Saum in token of their joy. On this, he (PBUH) said that
~~in this happiness of Prophet Musa, Muslims have a greater right to
~~observe Saum than the Jews. Consequently, he also observed Saum on 10th
~~of Muharram. Then, he said that if he lived the following year, he would
~~observe Saum on 9th of Muharram also so that they would make themselves
~~different from the Jews. According to another Hadith, he (PBUH) ordained
~~the Muslims to observe Saum on `Ashura' and in addition one more Saum on
~~9th or 11th of Muharram in opposition to the Jews. (Musnad Ahmad, Vol.4,
~~P-21, edited by Ahmad Shakir; and Mujamma` Az-Zawaid, Vol.3, P-188).
~~Thus observance of two Saum on this occasion is a Sunnah of the Prophet
~~(PBUH). These two Saum can be observed either on 9th and 10th or 10th
~~and 11th of Muharram. It is regrettable indeed that present-day Muslims
~~do not follow this Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH) and instead observe the
~~baseless practices of mourning assemblies (Majalis), which is a grave
~~sin practised by Shi`ah.

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: Some people think these words stand to mean that `he will
~~observe Saum on the 9th of Muharram only. But this interpretation does
~~not agree with other Ahadith. In order to oppose the Jews, he (PBUH)
~~resolved to observe one more Saum with that of 10th of Muharram and
~~ordained it for the Muslims. In this connection, we have quoted above
~~the authority from Musnad Ahmad. Hence, the meanings we have given in

~~the month of Ramadan, and also observes As-Saum for six days in the
~~month of Shawwal, it is as if he has observed As-Saum for the whole
~~year.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: According to the formula that there is at least ten-fold
~~reward for every virtue, the Saum of one month (Ramadan) are equivalent
~~to Saum of ten months. If one also observes six days of Saum of Shawwal,
~~they will be equal to Saum of two months. Thus, one becomes eligible for
~~the reward of one full years' Saum. He who makes it a permanent feature
~~is like one who observes Saum throughout his life. He will be considered
~~by Allah as one who observes Saum permanently. Although voluntary in
~~nature, they are highly important. One can observe these six-day Saum at
~~a stretch or with intervals, but their observance one after the other at
~~the beginning of the month is better. Similarly, if a person has missed
~~some Saum of Ramadan due to illness, travelling etc., he should first
~~make up the shortfall and then observe the voluntary six-day Saum of
~~Shawwal.

# Commentary: The true meanings of "Rafath'' sexual intercourse but it
~~also signifies obscene and frivolous talk and the expression of sexual
~~desire to one's wife. Since coition with one's wife is forbidden during
~~Hajj, so conversation with her on this subject or talking for amusement
~~is also disliked. "Fisq'' means disobedience of Allah and quarrelling
~~with people. One must avoid both of them during Hajj. The Hajj which is
~~performed with all these restrictions, has the merit that one is totally
~~purged of sins. But this purification is from sins which come in the
~~category of minor sins and which relate to the Rights of Allah. Major
~~sins relating to the Rights of Allah and lapses in respect of the rights
~~of people are not pardoned without sincere repentance and compensation

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith tells us that the merit of `Umrah is that it

~~`Umrah includes assuming Ihram, circumambulation of Ka`bah, going
~~between As-Safa and Al-Marwah and Halq or Taqsir (shaving of head or
~~cutting hair). Whether or not `Umrah is an obligation like Hajj is

# 1276. `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: I said: "O
~~Messenger of Allah! We consider Jihad as the best deed, should we not
~~then go for Jihad?'' The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "The best Jihad
~~for you women is Hajj Mabrur (i.e., one accepted by Allah).''
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: In ordinary circumstances, Hajj is the best of Jihad for
~~women because in Islam, politics, economy, government, military affairs
~~etc., come in the purview of men and men alone. Women are exempted from
~~all such matters. However, in case of war, if the need arises, women can
~~be engaged for supply of food, first-aid of the wounded etc., on the
~~internal front, provided they can do such works without crossing the
~~bounds of the Islamic-type veil. But imparting military training to
~~women and dispatching them to war front are sheer imitations of the
~~western nations for which there is no scope in the teachings of Islam.
~~This Hadith also confirms this view.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: "Equal to the performance of Hajj'' means the return and
~~reward to which Hajj is eligible. It does not mean that it will serve as
~~a substitute for Hajj and absolve one from the need to perform it. This
~~distinction of `Umrah in the month of Ramadan is perhaps for the reason,
~~that in this way two acts of worship are combined at one time.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: "Hajj has become obligatory in old age'' means that when
~~Allah has made Hajj obligatory, at that time, her father had attained
~~old age, or he came to possess the means in his old age which made him
~~liable for Hajj, but he is not capable of undertaking the journey
~~because of his poor health. In such cases, the Prophet (PBUH) has
~~granted them permission for Hajj by representation. But we learn from
~~other Ahadith that Hajj by representation can only be done through such
~~a person who has already performed Hajj. Similarly, if a person of means
~~dies without performing Hajj, it is essential that Hajj is performed on
~~his behalf; otherwise, he will be answerable for this omission. This
~~formula does not apply to parents who have died in poverty because they
~~were not liable for it. If someone does it for the sake of reward, he
~~will be hopefully granted the reward of voluntary Hajj.

# Commentary: "Zamilah'' is a mount like a horse, mule etc., on which

~~you collectively. But know that Allah is with those who are Al-Muttaqun
~~(the pious).'' (9:36)
# "Jihad (holy fighting in Allah's Cause) is ordained for you (Muslims)

# "March forth, whether you are light (being healthy, young and wealthy)
~~or heavy (being ill, old and poor), and strive hard with your wealth and
~~your lives in the Cause of Allah'' (9:41)
# "Verily, Allah has purchased of the believers their lives and their
~~properties for (the price) that theirs shall be the Jannah. They fight
~~in Allah's Cause, so they kill (others) and are killed. It is a promise
~~in truth which is binding on Him in the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel
~~(Gospel) and the Qur'an. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah?
~~Then rejoice in the bargain which you have concluded. That is the
~~supreme success.'' (9:111)
# "Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those
~~who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame), and those who strive
~~hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives.
~~Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their
~~wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah
~~has promised good (Jannah), but Allah has preferred those who strive
~~hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward. Degrees
~~of (higher) grades from Him, and forgiveness and mercy. And Allah is
~~Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'' (4:95, 96)
# "O you who believe! Shall I guide you to a trade that will save you
~~from a painful torment? That you believe in Allah and His Messenger
~~(Muhammad (PBUH)), and that you strive hard and fight in the Cause of
~~Allah with your wealth and your lives: that will be better for you, if
~~you but know! (If you do so) He will forgive you your sins, and admit
~~you into Gardens under which rivers flow, and pleasant dwellings in `Adn
~~(Eden) Jannah; that is indeed the great success. And also (He will give
~~you) another (blessing) which you love: help from Allah (against your

# Commentary: This Hadith has already been mentioned. See Hadith No.
~~1274. Different acts have been regarded more meritorious in different
~~Ahadith. For this reason, some scholars have performed the justification

~~mentioned with reference to circumstances and time or place. For

~~performing Salat in the early prescribed hours is more meritorious, or
~~Hajj through representative or Jihad is more meritorious, etc.
# Some scholars are of the opinion that the eminence of different acts
~~has been stressed keeping the person addressed in view.
# Linguistically, the word "Hajj'' means `journey to a place one
~~respects'. Technically, it means `journey to Makkah in order to perform

# 3. It also mentions the Prophet's passion for Jihad which is evident

~~قال : [ من قاتل في سبيل الله من رجل مسلم فواق ناقة وجبت له الجنة ومن جرح
~~جرحا في سبيل الله أو نكب نكبة فإنها تجيء يوم القيامة كأغزر ما كانت لونها
~~الزعفران وريحها كالمسك ] رواه أبو داود والترمذي وقال حديث صحيح
# 1296. Muadh (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet
~~(PBUH) said, "Jannah becomes incumbent for a Muslim who fights for the
~~Cause of Allah for a period as long as the time between two consecutive
~~turns of milking a she-camel. He who receives a wound or a bruise in the
~~Cause of Allah will appear on the Day of Resurrection as fresh as
~~possible, its colour will be the colour of saffron and its fragrance
~~will be that of musk.''
# [At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud].
# Commentary: "Fawaq'' is the period that intervenes between two
~~consecutive turns of milking a she-camel. It is a very short interval
~~and is an allusion to a very short period that one may spend in Jihad.
~~Even Jihad for such a short time is so meritorious that his entitlement
~~to Jannah is ensured by it, provided the Mujahid is sincere in his
~~intention and his past conduct is free from major sins and encroachment
~~on the rights of others.

~~عليه وسلم فذكر ذلك لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال : [ لا تفعل فإن
~~مقام أحدكم في سبيل الله أفضل من صلاته في بيته سبعين عاما ألا تحبون أن
~~يغفر الله لكم ويدخلكم الجنة ؟ اغزوا في سبيل الله من قاتل في سبيل الله

# [ الفواق ] : ما بين الحلبتين
# 1297. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: One of
~~the Prophet's Companions came upon a valley containing a rivulet of
~~fresh water and was delighted by it. He reflected: `I wish to withdraw
~~from people and settle in this valley; but I won't do so without the
~~permission of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH).' This was mentioned to the
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and he said (to the man), "Do not do that, for
~~when any of you remains in Allah's way, it is better for him than
~~performing Salat (prayer) in his house for seventy years. Do you not
~~wish that Allah should forgive you and admit you to Jannah? Fight in
~~Allah's way, for he who fights in Allah's Cause as long as the time
~~between two consecutive turns of milking a she-camel, will be surely
~~admitted to Jannah.''
# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: This Hadith brings out two important points:
# First, Jihad is far superior than voluntary Salat. This is perfectly
~~true because the benefit of Salat is restricted to the one who performs
~~it while the benefits of Jihad reach a vast number of people because it
~~is to safeguard the religion, raise the flag of Islam high and safeguard
~~the Islamic territories. But it is only possible when there is a general
~~proclamation for Jihad and there is such a severe fight that it is not
~~permissible for anyone to stay behind; that is to say, it becomes
~~obligatory. In the ordinary circumstances, when a general proclamation
~~for Jihad is not made, the voluntary Salat, is the best of all acts of
~~worship. Second, the Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) did not do
~~anything without the permission of the Prophet (PBUH).

# 1298. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) was asked: "What other good deed could be an
~~equivalent of Jihad in the way of Allah?'' He (PBUH) replied, "You do
~~not have the strength to do it.'' (The narrator said:) The question was
~~repeated twice or thrice, but every time he (PBUH) answered, "You do not
~~have the strength to do it.'' Then he (PBUH) said, "One who goes out for
~~Jihad in the Cause of Allah is like a person who observes Saum
~~(fasting), stands in Salat (prayer) constantly, recites the Ayat of the
~~Qur'an and does not exhibit any lassitude in fasting and prayer until
~~the participant of Jihad in the way of Allah returns.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: "Alqanit'' signifies one who makes recitation of the Ayat
~~of the Noble Qur'an with the fear of Allah and humility, or is
~~submissive and obedient to the Commands of Allah. The example cited here
~~means that so long a Mujahid is engaged in Jihad, he is like a person
~~who keeps himself occupied in Salat at night and observes Saum in the
~~day time. The action of such a person can be equal in reward to the
~~conduct of a Mujahid. Thus, in special situations Jihad is the most
~~meritorious act. A worshipper cannot attain that reward for his worship
~~which a Mujahid achieves in Jihad.

# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: "Feet soiled with dust'' means participation in Jihad.
~~That is to say, a person takes part in Jihad and yet goes to Hell is
~~altogether impossible. What it signifies is that Jihad is a means of
~~expiation of sins and that it guarantees the admission into Jannah,
~~provided he is not guilty of major sins. This exception is confirmed by
~~other Ahadith.

# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: This Hadith makes use of a metaphor to stress the
~~impossible. One who weeps for Fear of Allah and one who is covered with
~~the dust of the battlefield in the course of Jihad, will in no case
~~enter Hell until the milk drawn from udder goes back to it. The dust of
~~the battlefield of Jihad and the smoke of Hell cannot combine at one

# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: Here, the word canopy (tent) stands for a covered canopy
~~tent which can provide a Mujahid with shade for peace and comfort, and
~~"pay wages'' means to provide a servant who can help and serve him.
~~"Fahl'' literally means camel and "Taruqah'' is that young she-camel
~~which can bear offspring, that is a young healthy she-camel which can be
~~of service to the Mujahid. What all this means is that such work is
~~highly meritorious which can provide a Mujahid with comfort, power and

~~the Aslam tribe said: "O Messenger of Allah! I would very much like to
~~fight in the way of Allah but I do not have anything with which to equip
~~myself for fighting.'' The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Go to so-

~~the equipment that you have procured.'' The man said to his wife: "Give
~~him the equipment which I have collected for myself and do not withhold
~~anything from him. By Allah! Allah won't bless something you withheld
~~(in this respect).''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith also stresses the fact that if a person is
~~unable to take part in Jihad due to illness, for example, he should then
~~provide such material to a Mujahid which is helpful for him in Jihad. If
~~he does so, he will be eligible to the same reward which is due on
~~Jihad. This would also be a source of increase and growth in his
~~possessions. On the basis of this argument it has been stated that one
~~should always intend to expend his possession on something noble. He who
~~does not get the opportunity to expend it on what he had intended should
~~direct that material towards some other noble purpose.

# 1309. Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:
~~The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) sent an expedition to Banu Lahyan and
~~said, "One man from every two should join the fighting force, and the
~~reward will be shared amongst them equally.''
# [Muslim].
# Another narration in Muslim is: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said,
~~"Let one of every two men go forth'', and added: "Whoever stays behind
~~(and looks well after the family and the property of those who have
~~joined the expedition) will get half the reward of the warrior.''
# Commentary: "The reward will be shared amongst them equally'' or "will
~~get half the reward'' signifies one and the same thing. Some people
~~might mistakenly think that these two narrations of Sahih Muslim
~~apparently contradict each other because they imply that he who takes
~~part in Jihad and he who provides material to a Mujahid or looks after
~~the family of a Mujahid in his absence from home would get equal reward.
~~For this reason, some people have taken the word "half'' as superfluous
~~thinking that some narrator has added it in the text on his own. But Al-
~~Hafiz Ibn Hajar is of the opinion that after the acceptance of the
~~credibility of this Hadith and the proofs furnished in this regard, it
~~is unfair to ascribe addition of any word to the narrator. Its correct
~~interpretation seems to be that when the total reward of it will be
~~evenly distributed between the two, each of them will get the same
~~amount of reward. Hence there is no contradiction in these two Ahadith.
# This Hadith also tells us that Jihad is not an express obligation; and
~~if one of the two persons takes part in Jihad, it will suffice for the
~~other also. What can be inferred from this is that the others should
~~take part in Jihad in such a manner that those who have wealth, should
~~arrange for the military requirements of the Mujahidun and look after
~~their families, and in case any Mujahid is martyred, they should provide
~~financial help to his family if it does not have sufficient means for a
~~respectable living. Similarly, people in other walks of life should also
~~take part in Jihad in every possible manner.

~~urged him to say so. He replied: "Nothing, O Messenger of Allah! But
~~hope that I might become one of the inhabitants of Jannah.'' The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "You will definitely be among them.''
~~`Umair then took some dates out of his quiver and began to eat them, but
~~after a short time he said: "If I survive till I eat my dates, it will

# Commentary: This Hadith brings out the following three points:
# 1. The importance of the obedience of the leader. Soldiers should wait
~~for the orders of their commander, and should not take any step without
~~his orders.
# 2. In order to infuse the true spirit of Jihad among the soldiers,
~~they should be told and reminded about the blessings of Jannah so that
~~they fight with enthusiasm and valour for attaining it.
# 3. The Hadith manifests the love of the Companions of the Prophet
~~(PBUH) for the Hereafter which overwhelmed their interests in the
~~attractions of the life of the world.

~~من الأنصار يقال لهم القراء فيهم خالي حرام يقرؤون القرآن ويتدارسونه
~~بالليل : يتعلمون وكانوا بالنهار يجيئون بالماء فيضعونه في المسجد ويحتطبون

# 1316. Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Some people came
~~to the Prophet (PBUH) and said to him: "Send with us some men who may
~~teach us the Qur'an and the Sunnah.'' He (PBUH) sent seventy men from
~~the Ansar. They were called Al-Qurra` (the reciters) and among them was
~~my maternal uncle, Haram. They used to recite the Qur'an, ponder over
~~its meaning and learn (its wisdom) at night. In the day, they used to
~~bring water and pour it in pitchers in the mosque, then they would
~~collect wood and sell it; and with the sale proceeds, they would buy
~~food for the people of As-Suffah and the needy. The Prophet (PBUH) sent
~~the reciters with these people but these (treacherous people) fell upon
~~them and killed them before they reached their destination. (While
~~dying) they supplicated: "O Allah convey from us the news to our Prophet
~~that we have met You (in a way), that we are pleased with You and You
~~are pleased with us.'' (The narrator said:) A man attacked Haram from
~~behind and smote him with a spear which pierced him. Whereupon Haram
~~said: "By the Rubb of Ka`bah, I have met with success. The Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) said to his Companions, "Your brethren have been slain and
~~they were saying: "O Allah! Convey from us to our Prophet the news that
~~we have met You (in a way) that we are pleased with You and You are
~~pleased with us.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith mentions the following three points:
# 1. Through conspiracy infidels took with them seventy Ansari
~~Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) , who were distinguished for studying
~~and teaching the Noble Qur'an, and martyred them in their region. This
~~tragic incident goes to prove that the Prophet (PBUH) did not have the
~~knowledge of the Unseen. Had he possessed this knowledge, he would not
~~have sent his Companions with the infidels. When the Companions of the
~~Prophet (PBUH) realized that they were trapped and there was no chance
~~of their survival, they prayed to Allah to convey their message to the
~~Prophet (PBUH). Their prayer was answered by Allah Who conveyed their
~~message by means of Wahy (Revelation) to the Prophet (PBUH). On learning
~~it through Wahy, he (PBUH) informed this tragic incident to his
~~Companions.
# 2. "As-Suffah'' is a terrace in which people stayed, they had neither
~~any permanent source of income nor any free public kitchen nor was there
~~any arrangement for the supply of their food from individuals. They
~~depended entirely on the Grace of Allah.
# Every now and then they received some Sadaqah or gift and they all
~~shared it. Some of them would collect firewood and through its sale,
~~raised some money to purchase food for themselves and their Companions.
# 3. The task of invitation to Islam and dissemination of its teachings
~~is an arduous one. People who undertake this task have to face bitter
~~criticism from their friends and foes, and one has sometimes to lose
~~one's life in this mission. But this is a mission of the Prophets and it
~~should be undertaken by the savants as they are truly worthy of it.

~~you fought against the pagans. (By Allah!) if Allah gives me a chance to
~~fight against the pagans, no doubt, Allah will see how (bravely) I will

~~companions) have done, and I denounce what these (i.e., the pagans) have
~~done.'' Then he advanced and Sa`d bin Mu'adh met him. He said: "O Sa`d
~~bin Mu'adh! By the Rubb of An-Nadr, Jannah! I am smelling its aroma
~~coming from before (the mountain of) Uhud,'' Later on, Sa`d said: "O
~~Messenger of Allah! I cannot achieve or do what he (i.e., Anas bin An-
~~Nadr) did. We found more than eighty wounds by swords, spears and arrows
~~on his body. We found him dead and his body was mutilated so badly that
~~none except his sister could recognise him by his finger.'' We used to

~~of his sort: "Among the believers are men who have been true to their
~~covenant with Allah (i.e., they have gone out for Jihad, and showed not
~~their backs to the disbelievers), of them some have fulfilled their
~~obligations (i.e., have been martyred).'' (33:23).
# Commentary: This Hadith has been mentioned earlier. It was clarified
~~there by Imam An-Nawawi that the word "Layarayann-Allahu'' has been
~~mentioned in two forms. The translation given above accords with its
~~first form. In its second form, it means "Allah will manifest to the
~~people what I will do''. Through these words Anas bin Nadr expressed, in
~~very cautious words, his determination to fight chivalrously but
~~refrained from making any claim or pretension. Here, we have a lesson
~~that if one intends to do a good deed, he should not make any tall
~~claims about it but do it with his utmost effort when it is time to do
~~it. Almighty Allah will certainly make it manifest to the people. On the
~~contrary, if one does it for name and fame, the deed will go waste

~~"Prepare to meet them (the enemy) with as much strength as you can

~~is in archery.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: In accordance with the conditions of his times, the
~~Prophet (PBUH) ordained the Muslims to acquire every possible power and
~~keep it ready for war. Elucidating his order on this point, he stated
~~that by power he meant archery and then he repeated this word three
~~times to stress its importance. He did it because the art of archery had
~~fundamental importance in war at that time. In the present-day world,
~~archery has lost its value as it has been replaced by other inventions
~~like tanks, guns, missiles, atom bombs, etc. Similar is the case of
~~devices which are used in air and naval war, and all these military
~~wares have superb importance in modern warfare. In the present-day
~~context, the injunction of the Noble Qur'an to acquire power means
~~manufacturing and possession of all these devices. It is incumbent on
~~the Muslims that they equip themselves with all this material and show
~~no carelessness in this regard. In modern times, Muslims have badly
~~neglected this field with the result that non-Muslims have more
~~knowledge of modern warfare and by dint of that they are dominating the
~~world and making a claim of their supremacy all over the world. Unless
~~Muslims pursue the Qur'anic injunctions on this score and acquire
~~greater or equal or at least similar measure and style of power, as is
~~possessed by the non-Muslims, they will not be able to check the
~~onslaught of their enemies, and to defeat them. It is incumbent upon the
~~Muslims to overpower the might and power of the infidels for the

~~not ever think that if an opportunity ever comes in his way, he will
~~certainly go for Jihad in the way of Allah against the infidels. The
~~reason to that is that, to stay back at home at the time of Jihad was a
~~habit of the hypocrites. In the light of this, Imam Al-Qurtubi has
~~stated the principle that if one is not capable of doing some virtuous
~~deeds, he should then make a resolve that whenever he will be capable of
~~it, he will do that deed, so that his intention takes the place of his
~~act. He who neither performs a good deed nor aspires for it, has a

~~be more meritorious to free such a slave than ordinary ones. This
~~conduct furnishes the principle that the reward of sacrificing something

~~the greater its reward will be. The Qur'an expressly states:

# 1360. Al-Ma`rur bin Suwaid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I
~~saw Abu Dharr (May Allah be pleased with him) wearing a nice gown, and
~~his slave was also wearing one similar to it. I asked him about it, and
~~he said that he had exchanged harsh words with a person during the
~~lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and put him to shame by making
~~a reference to his mother. That person came to the Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) and made mention of that to him. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah
~~said, "You are a person who has remnants of the `Days of Ignorance' in
~~you. Your slaves are your brothers. Allah has placed them under your
~~authority. He who has his brother under him, should feed him from
~~whatever he eats, and dress him with whatever he wears, and do not
~~burden them (assign burdensome task to them) beyond their capacity; and
~~if you burden them then help them.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. This Hadith enjoins good treatment of the slaves and contains the
~~elucidation that one should give them the same food and clothes which
~~one has for oneself, or one should give them such wages that they can
~~have the same food and clothes which he has for himself because as far
~~as religion and humanity are concerned, the slaves have the status of
~~one's brother, and their human needs are not different from the needs of
~~their masters. This order also applies to labourers who work in
~~factories, shops and homes. They should be given wages for their work on
~~the strict consideration that they are also human beings and brothers -
~~as if they are members of one's family. It is regrettable indeed that
~~these teachings of Islam have been reglected in the Islamic countries.
~~Not to speak of treating them as brothers, the factory owners,
~~shopkeepers and capitalists of these countries are not prepared to treat
~~them as human beings. The result is that while these employers are
~~rolling in luxury, they do not give to their employees even such wages
~~which can suffice for their human needs. May Allah grant them the
~~ability to act upon the teachings of their religion.
# 2. It is equally important that the employees and labourers should not
~~be burdened with such heavy work which they are unable to bear. If the
~~employees are ever given any such work, the employers must share such
~~work with them.
# 3. Pride on one's own ancestory and condemnation of others on this
~~account are remnants of the Age of Ignorance which were rooted out by
~~Islam. Muslims should keep themselves away from such vainglorious
~~thoughts. It is a pity that this evil of the pre-Islamic age has now
~~been adopted again by Muslims. We find it very common in the present-day
~~Muslim societies.
# 4. By issuing the instruction mentioned in this Hadith, Islam has
~~arranged to establish equality in the true sense of the word. Islam does
~~not make any claim of uniting the labour class and weaker segments of
~~the society for confrontation with the capitalists because this breeds
~~class hatred which ruins the peace and progress of the society. Instead
~~of creating enmity, Islam fosters brotherhood between the employer and
~~employed, the master and the slave, the ruler and the ruled. It also
~~exhorts them to be sympathetic and helpful to each other. By stressing
~~the rights of people, it teaches both classes to love and respect each
~~other. This is the reason why in Islam the merit for distinction is not
~~wealth and abundance but Faith and fear of Allah alone which even the
~~poorest of the poor can possess and which may be missing even in the
~~richest of the rich in society.

~~give it to him; verily the best of you is the one who is the best in
~~discharging his obligations (repayment of loans).''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. It is stated that the lender was Zaid bin Shu`bah Al-Kinani who had
~~not yet embraced Islam and that accounts for his not showing due regard
~~to the Prophet (PBUH), and for his being stern in his demand. The
~~Prophet (PBUH) advised his Companions that it is well for the affluent

~~politeness in it, his rudeness should be ignored because he who has a
~~rightful claim, can tend to anger although he should not cross the
~~limits laid down by Shari`ah in this respect.
# 2. At the time of repayment of loan, it is Mustahabb (desirable) for
~~the debtor to pay with his own pleasure something more than due to the
~~lender; but if the lender demands more, this extra money will be deemed
~~interest Riba (or usury) which is neither lawful to receive nor to pay.

# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: "Adopts a kind attitude when he sells, buys, and demands
~~for the repayment of loans'' means that the buyer purchases in such a
~~manner that the seller does not suffer any loss, and the seller sells
~~his goods in such a way that the buyer does not feel any irritation.
~~This also means that he feels so liberal that if the buyer wants to
~~return what he has purchased he should accept it. Another meaning of
~~this is that while making a purchase the customer pays more than the due
~~price and the seller gives more goods than are due against the price
~~that he receives. Moreover, if one has to get his claim from someone, he
~~should do it in a polite manner. In no case should one cross the limits
~~of civility. If the debtor is poor, he should be given more time for the
~~repayment of his debt, or the loan should be remitted, as it will be in
~~accordance with the Qur'anic instruction that "If you remit by way of
~~charity, that is better for you.'' (2:280)

# Commentary: One meaning of the word "Falyunaffis'' is to defer

~~jealousy is forbidden and is held unlawful. The reason being that one
~~who is jealous wants that the person, who possesses the quality of which

~~reason that when one seems that a person has been graced by Allah with
~~certain gifts and qualities, he also desires to be blessed with those

~~becomes well-versed in the religion of Allah and receives benefit from
~~the Message entrusted to me by Allah, so he himself has learned and
~~taught it to others; such is also the similitude of the person who has
~~stubbornly and ignorantly rejected Allah's Guidance with which I have

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]
# Commentary: This Hadith has already been mentioned, and is repeated
~~here to highlight the eminence of knowledge and to induce Muslims to
~~gain it. We learn from this Hadith that there are three categories of
~~people. First, those who acquire knowledge of the Qur'an and Hadith, act
~~upon it and also impart it to others. Such people benefit from this
~~knowledge themselves and extend this benefit to others also. By virtue
~~of this quality they are the best of all. Second, those people who
~~acquire knowledge and impart it to others, but do not fulfill the
~~requirements of that knowledge. Such people are inferior in rank to the
~~people of the first category and can be taken to task for their
~~omissions. Third, those who shun the knowledge of the Qur'an and Hadith.
~~Neither they study and hear the two themselves for their own benefit,
~~nor do they acquire knowledge to impart it to others for their benefit.
~~This is the worst category of people. Every Muslim should try to be in
~~the first category of the people.

# Commentary: "Better for you than red camels'' is an allegory for every
~~thing that is better than anything else. Red camels used to be precious
~~in Arabia, and their reference here is to highlight the value of
~~guidance. Thus, this Hadith brings into prominence the importance of
~~calling people towards Allah. But before calling others to the path of

~~the Qur'an and Hadith is essential because one cannot provide any
~~guidance in this respect without this knowledge.

### ||| AUTO 1380 - وعن عبد الله بن عمرو بن العاص رضي الله عنه أن النبي
~~صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : [ بلغوا عني ولو آية وحدثوا عن بني إسرائيل ولا
~~حرج ومن كذب علي متعمدا فليتبوأ مقعده من النار ] رواه البخاري
# 1380. `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As (May Allah be pleased with them)
~~reported: The Prophet (PBUH) said, "Convey from me even an Ayah of the
~~Qur'an; relate traditions from Banu Israel, and there is no restriction
~~on that; but he who deliberately forges a lie against me let him have
~~his abode in the Hell.''
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: This Hadith contains the following three important points:
# 1. It stresses the importance of acquiring knowledge of the Qur'an and
~~Hadith and imparting it to others. No matter whether one has more or
~~less knowledge, he must communicate it to others. There is no
~~justification to presume that preaching or inviting to the Message of
~~Allah is the duty of religious scholars and those who are well-versed in
~~this sphere. In fact, it is a duty upon every Muslim, so much so that if
~~a person knows even a single Verse of the Qur'an, that is to say if he
~~knows only one injunction of Allah, he is duty bound to communicate it
~~to other people.
# 2. It allows the communication of Jewish Traditions but this
~~permission is subject to the condition that such Traditions are not
~~against the elucidations of the Qur'an and Hadith.
# 3. There is a stern warning on attributing any false saying to the
~~Prophet (PBUH). This demands strict scrutiny of Ahadith. If a Hadith
~~does not have a reliable authority or whose chain of narrators has a
~~false link or a person of doubtful integrity, that is to say if it is
~~weak, then it is a serious offense to quote it as a Hadith of the
~~Prophet (PBUH). There are various grades of weakness, and this requires
~~deep knowledge of the narrators and principles of Hadith to know them
~~since scholars who are expert in this discipline are few and far. The
~~safest course for ordinary scholars is to refrain from stating such
~~Ahadith which are weak, no matter whether the weakness is serious or
~~slight. The reason is that although the majority of Muhaddithun consider
~~the slightly weak Ahadith acceptable but they cannot be identified by
~~everybody. Thus, every Hadith which is marked as weak should not be
~~mentioned. In the present age Sheikh Nasiruddin Al-Albani has done a
~~very remarkable work in this field. He has separated the weak Ahadith
~~found in the four famous volumes of Ahadith (Sunnan Abu Dawud, At-
~~Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah) from the authentic and prepared
~~separate volumes of authentic and weak Ahadith. This work of Al-Albani
~~has made it easy for the ordinary `Ulama' to identify the weak Ahadith.
~~Only a man of Sheikh Al-Albani's calibre can do research on it. The
~~ordinary `Ulama' and religious scholars of the Muslims are heavily
~~indebted to him for this great work and they should keep it in view
~~before mentioning any Hadith. They should mention only the authentic
~~Ahadith and refrain from quoting the weak ones. It is wrong to ignore
~~this work on the ground that Sheikh Al-Albani is not the last word on
~~the subject. There can be a possibility of error in his work because it
~~is after all a human effort, but it will be very unfair to regard his
~~effort of no account merely because of a possible error. It is
~~regrettable indeed that only because of this possible error many people
~~refuse to accept even the correctness of the Sahihain. (i.e., Sahih Al-
~~Bukhari and Sahih Muslim). Should we then accept their view? No,
~~certainly not. So there is no sense in not making use of Sheikh Al-
~~Albani's matchless contribution. As Muhaddithun have done a great
~~service to the Muslim Ummah by collecting and compiling the Ahadith,
~~similarly in the style of Muhaddithun, and in keeping with the
~~principles laid down by them, the research carried out to separate the
~~authentic Ahadith from the weak is in fact an effort to complete their
~~mission. In this age, Almighty Allah has bestowed this honour on Sheikh
~~Al-Albani. May Allah protect him, give him the best of the reward and
~~give him a long life.
# We now revert to the subject under discussion and say that no such
~~saying and practice should be attributed to the Prophet (PBUH) the
~~authenticity of which is doubtful. On this principle, weak Ahadith,
~~should not be mentioned. It is very unfortunate indeed that in spite of
~~such a stern warning, many of our `Ulama' are not careful in this
~~matter. Not to speak of weak Ahadith, they do not hesitate to mention
~~even Ahadith Maudu`ah forged Ahadith) only to adorn their speech. May
~~Allah guide them to the Right Path. In fact, there is a class of
~~religious scholars who try to refute the authentic Ahadith and validate
~~the weak ones only to add credence to their own juristic school. May
~~Allah save us from such evils.

~~First, Sadaqah Jariyah such as building a mosque, or a hospital, or
~~digging a well. As long as people will benefit from these, he will
~~receive a reward for them. Second, "knowledge which is beneficial''
~~means to impart knowledge to others or to propagate knowledge by means
~~of one's books. As long as this medium of teaching will continue and his
~~books will be studied and people will benefit from them, he will receive
~~a reward for it. Third, virtuous descendants. Training of children on

~~dwellers of the heaven and the earth, and even the ant in its hole and
~~the fish (in water) supplicate in favour of those who teach people
~~knowledge.''
# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: `Alim (learned person) here means scholar of the Qur'an
~~and Hadith, who adheres to Faraid and Sunnah and remains busy in
~~learning and imparting knowledge. `Abid (devout worshipper) is one who
~~spends most of his time in the worship of Allah. The benefit of his
~~voluntary prayer and remembrance of Allah is restricted to his own self
~~while the benefit of knowledge of the scholar reaches others also.
~~Hence, of the two, the latter is far superior.
# If Salat is mentioned with reference to Allah, it denotes "Allah's
~~Grace with Mercy;'' if it is mentioned with reference to the angels, it
~~denotes "to pray for forgiveness;'' and if it is mentioned with
~~reference to other creatures - men, animals, etc., - then it means
~~prayer and supplication. Thus, Allah graces that person with His Mercy
~~who teach people the beneficial knowledge, i.e., the knowledge of Islam;
~~angels pray to Allah to forgive his (or her) sins; and other creatures
~~pray for his (or her) well-being. In this way, this Hadith stresses the
~~distinction of religious scholars and highlights the esteem in which
~~they are held by Allah, His angels and His other creatures.

~~such a scholar will not even smell the fragrance of Jannah (i.e., he

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: Recitation of Salat upon the Prophet (PBUH) means the
~~recitation of benediction. Such as the one recited in Salat "O Allah,

~~the Prophet (PBUH) which is highly meritorious. (At-Tirmidhi, Hadith

~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: "The people who will be nearest to me on
~~the Day of Resurrection will be those who supplicate Allah more often
~~for me.''
# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: "Nearest to me'' signifies "those who are most entitled to

~~frequent recitation of Salat on the Prophet (PBUH).

~~وقد أرمت ؟ ( قال : يقول بليت ) قال : [ إن الله حرم على الأرض أجساد
~~الأنبياء ] رواه أبو داود بإسناد صحيح
# 1399. Aus bin Aus (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Among the best of your days is Friday;
~~so supplicate Allah more often for me in it , for your supplications
~~will be displayed to me.'' He was asked: "O Messenger of Allah! How will
~~our blessings be displayed to you when your decayed body will have mixed
~~with the earth?'' He (PBUH) replied, "Allah has prohibited the earth
~~from consuming the bodies of the Prophets.''
# [Abu Dawud].
# Commentary: That "Allah has prohibited the earth from consuming the
~~bodies of the Prophets'' means that the earth does not consume them.
~~That "their Salat (salutations) will be presented to him'' indicates
~~that angels present the salutation performed to him, as is elucidated in
~~other Ahadith. Moreover, his soul is then returned to him and he answers
~~the salutations also. (In the opinion of Muhaddithun, the Hadith
~~relating to the return of the soul comes in the category of "Hadith
~~Hasan'', i.e., it is acceptable).

~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "May his nose soil with dust in whose
~~presence mention is made of me and he does not supplicate for me.''
# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: "May his nose soil with dust'' means to suffer humiliation
~~and disgrace. That is "may such person be humiliated and disgraced who
~~hears my name and does not invoke Allah's blessings upon me.'' Those who
~~merely kiss thumbs of their hands can also be the addressee of this
~~saying because they do not supplicate Allah for the Prophet (PBUH) while
~~what is in fact ordained is salutation, and not kissing of thumbs. The
~~latter gesture has not been ordained in any Hadith. Some religious
~~scholars regard the salutation obligatory while others hold that it
~~desirable.

~~of Allah (PBUH) said, "Do not make my grave a place of festivity, and
~~supplicate Allah for me, for your supplication reaches me wherever you are.''
# [Abu Dawud].
# Commentary: "Do not make my grave a place of festivity'' means do not
~~gather there as people do on the festival of `Eid. Unfortunately, a
~~fraction of heretics consider such festivities laudable. When the
~~Prophet (PBUH) did not like such gatherings on his own grave, how can it
~~be permissible on the death anniversaries of other people? Some people
~~misinterpret this Hadith and contend that what it means is that `You
~~should not come to my grave once in a while but very frequently''
~~although its real meaning is that which we have just mentioned. The next
~~sentence confirms this contention. There is no need for frequent
~~gathering for the reason that wherever a Muslim may be, the salutations
~~which he performs to the Prophet (PBUH) will be conveyed to him through
~~the angels. Every Muslim has a desire to visit the Prophet's grave, and
~~there cannot be any doubt about its desirability, but there is no need
~~to undertake journey for paying homage and salutation only. In fact, the
~~real intention of going to Al-Madinah should be to visit Prophet's
~~Mosque which will include visiting his grave. This is the real meaning
~~of this Hadith. There is another Hadith which prohibits undertaking a
~~journey to any mosque except the three which have been marked by the
~~Prophet (PBUH).

### ||| AUTO 1402 - وعنه رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم
~~قال : [ ما من أحد يسلم علي إلا رد الله علي روحي حتى أرد عليه السلام ]

# 1402. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Whenever someone greets me, Allah
~~returns the soul to my body (in the grave) and I return his greeting.''
# [Abu Dawud].
# Commentary: We learn from this Hadith that the Prophet (PBUH) is alive
~~in his grave and he answers the salutation offered by a Muslim. But this
~~life of his is the life of Barzakh (an intervening state between death
~~and the Day of Resurrection, and whoever dies, enters it) the reality of
~~which is not known to us. Thus, it is wrong to say that the life of the
~~Prophet (PBUH) is like worldly life or more vigorous than it. Such a
~~claim is baseless because it is not confirmed by the Qur'an and Hadith.
~~Were he to be alive the way he was in his lifetime, there would have
~~been no need for "the returning of the soul to his body'' and he would
~~be able to answer the salutations without it. As far this ambiguity is
~~concerned, when countless Muslims are always offering salutations to the
~~Prophet (PBUH) how does the return of the soul takes place after such
~~short intervals? Such questions arise due to the lack of certitude in
~~the Omnipotence of Allah. When the Prophet (PBUH) stated that his soul
~~is returned to him then we should have absolute faith in his statement
~~because Allah is Capable of doing every thing. What is its nature and
~~form, it is not known to us, nor can we know it. Thus, the question of
~~the return of soul in the grave should be considered similar to the
~~ambiguous Ayat of the Qur'an in which every Muslim is required to have
~~blind faith but their secret is known to Allah Alone.
# This Hadith has an inducement for offering more and more supplications
~~for the Prophet (PBUH) so that the devotee is blessed with the maximum
~~reward in the form of the Prophet's response to his salutations. It is
~~certainly a great blessing which a Muslim should try every nerve to
~~achieve.

~~Allah (PBUH) said, "The miser is the one in whose presence I am
~~mentioned but he does not supplicate for me.''
# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: "Miser'' means to deny someone his right. If a Muslim does
~~not supplicate for him upon hearing his name, then such a person is a
~~miser beyond doubt. Thus, we learn that one must recite Salat when he
~~hears the name of the Prophet (PBUH). It is sufficient to say May Allah
~~render him from evil and exalt his mention) for this purpose.

# 1404. Fadalah bin `Ubaid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) heard some one supplicating after his prayer
~~without praising Allah and without supplicating Allah for the Prophet
~~(PBUH). With regard to him, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "This
~~man rushed.'' Then he called him and said, "When any one of you have
~~performed Salat (prayer) and wants to supplicate, let him praise Allah
~~first then glorify Him in the beginning and then he should supplicate
~~Allah for me. Then he may supplicate for whatever he likes.''
# [Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: "Fi salatihi" means that after the Salat or at the end of
~~Salat, he heard someone invoking Allah. Similarly, "idha salla
~~ahadukum'' means when one completes the Salat and invokes Allah. In any
~~case, it is necessary to praise Allah and supplicate Him for the Prophet
~~(PBUH) before invoking Allah.

# 1405. Abu Muhammad Ka`b bin `Ujrah (May Allah be pleased with him)

~~of Allah, we already know how to greet you (i.e., say As-salamu
~~`alaikum), but how should we supplicate for you?'' He (PBUH) said, "Say:

~~and Glorious. O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as You
~~blessed the family of Ibrahim. You are Praised and Glorious.'''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: In this Hadith, the Salam means the supplication which is
~~recited in At-Tashahhud. The Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) used to
~~recite it in At-Tashahhud in the manner taught by him. When Almighty
~~Allah ordained Muslims to supplicate for the Prophet (PBUH), it raised
~~the question in their minds as to the wordings of the benediction (as
~~they already knew how to greet him). They asked the Prophet (PBUH) and
~~he taught it. Invoking Allah's blessings upon the Prophet (PBUH) should
~~be done in the manner which he (PBUH) has taught us, because in doing so
~~we get the reward of following the guidance of the Prophet (PBUH).

~~Sa`d said: "O Messenger of Allah! Allah has commanded us to supplicate

~~silent. We were much perturbed over his silence and we wished he did not

~~exalted the family of Ibrahim. And bless Muhammad and the family of
~~Muhammad as You blessed the family of Ibrahim. You are the Praised, the
~~Glorified,' and the method of greeting (i.e., Salam) is as you know.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: In this Hadith, the Prophet (PBUH) has showed us that the
~~manner of offering Salam was the same as the one mentioned in the
~~previous Hadith. "Al'' means the wives of the Prophet (PBUH) and those
~~of his relatives who were from Banu Hashim and Banu `Abdul-Muttalib and
~~had embraced Islam. Some scholars are of the opinion that it is general
~~and applies to all his followers.
# This Hadith also teaches us that if one does not have knowledge of a
~~religious matter, he must seek guidance from the knowledgeable scholars
~~of Islam about it, rather than going by his opinion. Knowledgeable
~~persons (scholars) here means persons who are well-versed in the Qur'an
~~and Hadith and can answer questions in the light of them, and not from

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: "Azwaj'' is the plural of "Zauj'' that is a pair. This is
~~the reason that in Arabic it applies to both, masculine as well as
~~feminine. Man is the Zauj of woman and woman is the Zauj of a man. In
~~any case, here it means the Prophet's wives who are eleven in number.
~~Two of them had died during the lifetime of the Prophet (PBUH) and nine
~~survived after him. Islam does not permit more than four wives to a
~~Muslim but the Prophet (PBUH) was given the exclusive permission for
~~numerous considerations which have been discussed by religious scholars
~~at length.
# This Hadith also refutes the opinion of those who do not include his
~~pious wives in the category of his "Al''. The progeny of the Prophet
~~(PBUH) includes his male and female children and their descendants. But
~~after his death none except Fatimah (May Allah be pleased with her) and
~~her children remained alive. In short, his "Al'' includes his wives and

~~Balance, and the expression: `Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah)'
~~fills the space between the heavens and the earth.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: "Tuhur'' is purification or Wudu', while "Tahur'' is water
~~or something which is used for purification. According to some scholars,
~~`Faith'' means Salat. This is also the sense in which it has been used
~~in the Qur'an: "And Allah would never make your Faith to be lost (i.e.,
~~your prayers).'' [2:143]. Thus when Salat is the Faith, the purification
~~is a prerequisite for Salat. Salat is not valid without purification.
~~Some scholars are of the opinion that Faith here means Faith in general,
~~as the Shari`ah defines it: To sincerely accept and believe in all that
~~the Prophet (PBUH) came with, i.e., sincere acceptance of Allah and His
~~Prophet (PBUH).
# "Purification is half of the Faith'' means the acceptance that
~~purification is the most important article of Faith. It is like the
~~saying of the Prophet (PBUH) that "Hajj is `Arafah'', which means that
~~`Arafat (the place where the pilgrims stay on the 9th day of Dhul-
~~Hijjah) is the most important element of the Hajj. Thus, this Hadith
~~stresses the importance and merits of purification and offers an
~~inducement for it. It also mentions the eminence of the invocations
~~mentioned in the Hadith by saying that if they are given a form, they
~~will fill the space between the heavens and the earth. In other words,
~~it is a description of the infinite vastness of the Mercy and Grace of Allah.

### ||| AUTO 1435 - وعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله
~~عليه وسلم قال : [ يقول الله تعالى : أنا عند ظن عبدي بي وأنا معه إذا
~~ذكرني فإن ذكرني في نفسه ذكرته في نفسي وإن ذكرني في ملأ ذكرته في ملأ خير
~~منهم ] متفق عليه
# 1435. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Allah the Exalted says: `I am as my
~~slave expects me to be, and I am with him when he remembers Me. If he
~~remembers Me inwardly, I will remember him inwardly, and if he remembers
~~Me in an assembly, I will remember him in a better assembly (i.e., in
~~the assembly of angels).''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: "I am as my slave expects me to be'' means that one should
~~have the conviction that He accepts repentance, grants pardon, relieves
~~people of their tensions and emancipates them from their troubles. Along
~~with this conviction one should do good deeds which please Allah and
~~avoid such deeds which have been prohibited by Him. With this conduct,
~~one should hope for the best from Allah. This approach is similar to
~~that of a cultivator who ploughs his land, sows the seed, waters it,
~~takes every possible care of it and then cherishes hope for a good crop.
~~It can also be linked to the endeavours of a person who intends to
~~become a scholar, or a physician or an engineer. The first and foremost
~~requirement to pursue his ambition is to study the books through which
~~he can gain the required knowledge. For every work one intends to do,
~~one has to first make a foundation and then acquire the means essential
~~for it. It is only then that one can hope to achieve one's aim.
# Similar is the case of associating good hopes with Allah. Unless a
~~person does not furnish the foundation of Faith and good deeds for it,
~~it will be unwise to associate good hopes with Allah. A slave who rather
~~than serving his master runs away or annoys him and still hopes that his
~~master being so kind will not take him to task for his excesses would be
~~called stupid by the people. The same is true of Allah, who is certainly
~~the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful and Forgiving. But for whom is
~~He so? The answer is for His faithful and obedient slaves and not for
~~those who are followers of Satan. For Satan and his followers, Allah's
~~Decision is that: "I will fill Hell with you (Iblis) and those of them
~~(mankind) that follow you, together.'' (38:85).

# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: Shara'i` is the plural of Shari`ah Shari`ah is in the
~~sense of Mashru`ah, that is the Divine injunctions. These Divine
~~injunctions are of various kinds, i.e., some of them are obligatory,
~~some desirable and some voluntary. The obligatory ones are compulsory
~~and their compliance is indispensable. What is termed as Mustahabbat
~~(desirables) are also highly important for gaining the Pleasure of
~~Allah. Similarly, voluntary acts are a means of getting close to Allah.
~~Ordinary people are sometimes puzzled by the abundance of the latter and
~~want to adhere to the first two, that is obligations and what comes in
~~the category of desirables. A desire to this effect is mentioned in this
~~Hadith. The Prophet (PBUH) answered the query in this matter by saying
~~to the inquirer, "Keep your tongue wet with the remembrance of Allah.''
~~Keeping the tongue wet with the remembrance of Allah here means its
~~abundant recitation. In other words, one should make the remembrance of
~~Allah a permanent feature. If one is not able to do many voulntary good
~~works, which some people find difficult, the remembrance of Allah will
~~make up the deficiency in that regard.

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: Such religious scholars take support from this Hadith who
~~hold that the recitation of the Qur'an is permissible in a state of
~~Janabah (resulting from coition) and menses. Imam Al-Bukhari is also
~~included among those who hold this view. They say that the words "at all
~~times'' clearly means that. The Prophet (PBUH) used to remember Allah
~~(which includes the recitation of the Qur'an also) no matter whether he
~~was in a state of minor or major pollution. For this reason, Sheikh Al-
~~Albani has objected Imam An-Nawawi's mentioning these two exceptions
~~(pollution resulting from coition and menses) in the relevant title, and
~~has stated that there is no Hadith in support of these exceptions. In
~~fact, the Hadith narrated by `A ishah (May Allah be pleased with her)
~~contradicts this view. In the opinion of this school of thought, the
~~Ahadith which prohibit the remembrance of Allah when a person is in the
~~state of Janabah are weak in authority and are open to discussion. Thus,
~~such Ahadith do not prove the prohibition. In the opinion of the second
~~school of thought, which holds the opposite view, such Ahadith carry
~~weight despite being weak in authority, because their weakness is not
~~serious. Some of them even believe that such Ahadith come to the level
~~of Hadith Hasan. So far logic is concerned, the viewpoint of the first
~~school carries more weight but the reverence of the Qur'an also calls
~~for caution. The best way to create conformity between the two views is
~~that in inevitable situations one may go by the first view but in the
~~ordinary circumstances it is better to follow the second view. Allah
~~Alone knows what is right.

# 1468. `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:

~~wat-tuqa, wal-`afafa, wal-ghina (O Allah! I beseech You for guidance,
~~piety, chastity and contentment).''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: "Guidance'' means guidance towards virtue which one needs
~~at every step. The ability to do good and steadfastness on the Right
~~Path is also covered by the term guidance. To comply with the Orders of
~~Allah and to prevent oneself from what He has forbidden is Taqwa (fear
~~of Allah), the importance of which needs no elaboration. `Affaf is
~~prevention from sins. It also means evasion from seeking help from
~~others. Ghina means riches which makes one independent of others so much
~~so that all one's hopes are centered on Allah Alone. The prayer quoted
~~in this Hadith is very comprehensive indeed.

# 1471. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The
~~Prophet (PBUH) said, "Seek refuge in Allah against the turmoils, attacks
~~of misfortunes, and evil of judgement and joys of the enemies.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: The trouble of a trial which is unbearable for a person
~~and from which he does not have the power to rid himself is called (juhd
~~al-bala'), translated here as `turmoils'. Some people are of the opinion
~~that it is synonymous with poverty combined with abundant children. But
~~Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar is of the view that it is only one of the several
~~kinds of "Troubles of a Trial.'' "Ash-Shaqa' is the opposite of good
~~fortune, that is, to pray for protection from misfortune. No Decision of
~~Allah is wrong but some of His Decisions may be harmful for certain
~~people while others are beneficial for them. This means that their
~~goodness or badness is related to persons. What it signifies is that one
~~should pray to Allah to keep one safe from such decisions which are
~~harmful for him. "Shamatat'' the pleasure that one's enemy feels on
~~one's trouble. In other words, it is prayed that Allah may protect one
~~from any such trouble which is pleasing to one's enemy, because when a
~~person is in trouble, his enemies feel pleasure over it. In this Hadith,
~~one sentence was added by Abu Sufyan and during his old age he did not
~~remember which one it was. But we learn from other Ahadith that it was
~~"the pleasure of enemies''. (Ibn `Allan). This Hadith also shows the
~~honesty and integrity of the narrators of Ahadith. They were honest to
~~the extent that if a few words of supplication were added to a Hadith by
~~its narrators, they would point it out. Some scholars have regarded
~~these words an addition in the Hadith by its narrator, who is otherwise
~~reliable, but it is not a problem of "addition of authority'' because in
~~that case, the addition is the saying of the Prophet (PBUH) which is
~~mentioned by one narrator and omitted by another. But here it is quite
~~different as the narrator of the Hadith himself is pointing out the
~~addition made by him. Such additional words are technically called
~~"Mudraj''

~~Another narration is: `Allahumma inni as'aluk-alhuda was-sadad (I beg

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: The Prophet (PBUH) was sinless but still he prayed

~~the declining of Your Favours, passing of safety, the suddenness of Your
~~punishment and all that which displeases You).''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This is also a very comprehensive prayer. Allah has
~~blessed man with innumerable gifts. One becomes conscious of them when
~~one is deprived of any of them, hence it is said that the value of a
~~blessing is realized at its loss. For eyes, ears, tongue, health,
~~property, children and such countless blessings, we owe gratitude to
~~Allah. In the prayer cited in this Hadith, one entreats Allah not to
~~deprive of any blessing given to him. `Afiyah means safe from disease,
~~grief and troubles. "Passing of the safety (`Afiyah)'' signifies the
~~change from a state of good health to a state of illness and weakness or
~~that one is overtaken by troubles and afflictions.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# The narration of Muslim is: "The supplication of a slave continues to

# Commentary: We learn from this Hadith that one should continue
~~beseeching Allah without ever thinking that in spite of praying for a

~~frustration to overcome in his mind. If a person's supplication is not
~~granted for a long time, there would be certainly some good for him in

# There are some more narrations in both Al-Bukhari and Muslim with very
~~minor differences in wordings and in details.
# Commentary: We learn the following points from this Hadith:
# 1. It is permissible to take students of religious schools home for
~~meals, as was the practice in certain areas in the past.
# 2. A father can admonish his children for disciplinary purposes.
# 3. If a better situation develops, one can break his vow and go for
~~the new and better choice. It is, however, necessary to expiate for
~~breaking the vow.
# 4. This Hadith affirms miracles. This is evident from the fact that a
~~small quantity of food was so blessed by Allah that all the members of
~~the family, guests, the Prophet (PBUH) and twelve "Arif'' (leader) along
~~with their companions took that food. (Gist of the text of Hadith from
~~Fath Al-Bari, Kitab Al-Manaq.)

~~(May Allah be pleased with him) appointed `Ammar (May Allah be pleased

~~did not even conduct As-Salat (the prayers) properly. `Umar (May Allah
~~be pleased with him) sent for Sa`d and said to him: "O Abu Ishaq, the
~~people claim that you do not offer the Salat properly.'' Sa`d replied:
~~"By Allah! I observe Salat according to the Salat of the Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH), and I make no decrease in it. I prolong Qiyam (standing)
~~in the first two Rak`ah in Maghrib and `Isha' prayers and shorten in the

~~thought of you, O Abu Ishaq!'' Then he sent with him a man (or some men)
~~to Kufah to investigate the matter about him (from the people of Kufah).
~~The inquiry was conducted in every mosque and all the people in these

~~name of Usamah bin Qatadah and surname Abu Sa`dah, stood up and said,
~~"Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas did not participate in Jihad and he did not
~~distribute the spoils equitably and did not judge justly.'' On this Sa`d
~~said: "I shall make three supplications in respect of him: O Allah! If
~~this slave of Yours is a liar and seeker of notoriety, please prolong
~~his life and lengthen his period of adversity and afflict him with

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith brings out the following four points:
# 1. The distinction of Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas (May Allah be pleased with
~~him) and the fact that his prayers were granted by Allah.
# 2. The principle that if inquiry is conducted against anybody, one
~~should inquire the opinion of the righteous and worthy people about the

# 3. Government officials can be dismissed in the interest of public
~~good, as `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) dismissed Sa`d bin Abu

~~thought it wise to dismiss him so that no one amongst his subject would

# 4. This Hadith also proves the correctness of marvels. The acceptance

~~1509. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) sent an espionage mission of ten men under the
~~leadership of `Asim bin Thabit Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with
~~him). They proceeded till they reached Al-Had'ah, a place between `Usfan
~~and Makkah and the news of their arrival reached a section of the tribe
~~of Hudhail, called Banu Lihyan. About one hundred men, who were all
~~archers, hurried to follow their tracks. When `A sim and his companions
~~came to know of their pursuers, they took refuge in a safe place. The
~~infidels encircled them and said to them: "Come down and surrender, and
~~we promise and guarantee you that we will not kill anyone of you.''
~~`Asim bin Thabit (May Allah be pleased with him) said: "By Allah! I will
~~not come down to be under the protection of disbelievers. O Allah!
~~convey this news to our Prophet (PBUH).'' Then the infidels shot arrows
~~at them till they killed `Asim. Three men came down relying on their
~~promise and covenant. They were Khubaib, Zaid bin Ad-Dathinah and
~~another man. When the disbelievers captured them, they tied them up with
~~the strings of their bows. The third of the captives said: "This is the
~~beginning of first betrayal. By Allah! I will not go with you. I have a
~~good example in these (martyrs).'' So they dragged him and tried to
~~compel him to accompany them, but he refused. At last they killed him.
~~They took Khubaib and Zaid bin Ad-Dathina with them and sold them as
~~slaves in Makkah. This incident took place after the battle of Badr.
# Khubaib was bought by the sons of Al-Harith bin `Amir bin Naufal bin
~~`Abd Manaf. It was Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith in the battle of
~~Badr. Khubaib remained a prisoner with those people for a few days till
~~the sons of Al-Harith resolved to kill him.
# When Khubaib (May Allah be pleased with him) got wind of this plot, he
~~borrowed a razor from one of Al-Harith's daughters in order to remove
~~his pubic hair. Her little son crawled towards Khubaib because of her
~~carelessness. Later on, she saw her son on his thigh and the razor was
~~in his hand. She got scared so much that Khubaib noticed the agitation
~~on her face and said: "Are you afraid that I will kill him? No, I will
~~never do that.'' She later remarked (after Al-Khubaib got martyred): "By
~~Allah! I never saw a prisoner better than Khubaib.'' She added: "By
~~Allah! I saw him once eating of a bunch of grapes in his hand while he
~~was chained and there was no such fruit at that time in Makkah. Probably
~~it was a boon which Allah bestowed upon Khubaib.''
# When they took him out of the Haram of Makkah to kill him outside its
~~boundaries, Khubaib requested them to let him offer two Rak`ah of
~~voluntary prayer. They allowed him and he offered two Rak`ah prayer.
~~Then he said: "Had I not apprehended that you would think that I was
~~afraid of death, I would have prolonged the prayer. O Allah! Count their
~~number; slay them one by one and spare not one of them.'' He then
~~recited these poetic verses:
# `I do not care how they kill me as long as I get martyred in the Cause
~~of Allah as a Muslim. I received my death for Allah's sake. If Allah so
~~desires, He will bless, the amputated limbs of the torn body.'
# Then the son of Al-Harith killed him. It was Khubaib who set the
~~tradition for any Muslim sentenced to death in captivity to offer two
~~Rak`ah of voluntary prayer. On that day the Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
~~informed his Companions of the martyrdom of Khubaib. Later on, when some
~~disbelievers from Quraish were informed that `Asim had been martyred,
~~they sent some people to fetch a significant part of his body to
~~ascertain his death. (This was because) `Asim had killed one of their
~~chiefs. So Allah sent a swarm of wasps, resembling a shady cloud, to
~~hover over the body of `Asim and to shield him from their messengers,
~~and thus they could not cut off anything from his body.
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: "Raht'' means a group or party. Some people say it
~~consisted of six persons - `Asim bin Thabit, Marthad bin Abu Marthad,
~~Khubaib bin `Adi, Zaid bin Ad-Dathina, `Abdullah bin Tariq and Khalid
~~bin Bukair (May Allah be pleased with him) Some say that it comprised
~~ten persons. Allah knows better.
# The incident reported in this Hadith has many miracles and marvels.
~~For instance, according to his prayer, the news of his assassination was
~~conveyed by Allah through Wahy to the Prophet (PBUH) on the very day
~~when he was martyred and he (PBUH) informed his Companions about it.
# Second, Allah provided Khubaib with grapes when they were out of
~~season during his imprisonment.
# Third, Allah sent wasps for the safety of `Asim's corpse.
# Fourth, his enemies met with the evil end which he had imprecated for them.
# This Hadith brings forth the following six points:
# 1. If one's enemy shows strictness and oppression, then he should not
~~accept the offer of protection from them even if he is killed as a
~~result of this. One can, however, try to save his life if he sees some
~~signs of leniency in the enemy's attitude.
# 2. The matchless perseverance and steadfastness of the Companions of
~~the Prophet (PBUH) and their patience on the tyrannies perpetrated on
~~them by their enemies.
# 3. Even in the worst of circumstances, the Companion of the Prophet
~~(PBUH) (i.e., Khubaib) maintained the best standard of morality and did
~~not harm the enemy's child in any way.
# 4. If the enemy is bent upon killing, then it is permissible to
~~request them for permission to offer two Rak`ah of voluntary Salat
~~because this act of Khubaib (May Allah be pleased with him) was upheld
~~by the Prophet (PBUH).
# 5. It is lawful to imprecate for oppressors and disbelievers.
# There are many Ahadith on the validity of marvels and miracles which
~~have been mentioned in the present book in different chapters. The
~~following instances can be quoted in this respect:
# 1. The incident of the boy who used to visit a priest and a magician.
~~(See the Chapter on Patience).
# 2. The story of Juraij (which occurs in the Chapter on Sincerity).
# 3. The story of the men of the cave, the entrance of which was closed
~~with a huge stone. (The Chapter on Generosity).
# 4. The story of the man who had heard the voice from the clouds
~~ordering them to shower rain on a particular garden (the Chapter on
~~Generosity).
# Many other incidents also come in this category which are supported by
~~evidence and are well-known. Allah is Capable of doing everything.

# [Imam Malik and At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: This Hadith tells us a fact which can be observed in our
~~everyday life. Sometimes a person utters a good sentence which pleases
~~an individual and he reforms himself or holds himself from doing
~~something wrong. Such a sentence or utterance is highly rewarded by
~~Allah. Similarly, sometime a person utters a mischievous sentence, the
~~ruinous effects of which he does not realize. This utterance hurts
~~someone's feelings and leads him to sin and evil. Almighty Allah is
~~displeased with such a person. The lesson that this Hadith has for us is
~~that one should strictly guard his speech and weigh his words to avoid
~~Allah's Wrath.

# [At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: Faith in Allah and all His Attributes is the basis of all

~~the Zakat, observe Saum (fasting) during Ramadan and perform Hajj
~~(pilgrimage) to the House of Allah, if you can afford it.'' He (PBUH)
~~further said, "Shall I not guide you to the gates of goodness? Fasting
~~is a screen (from Hell), charity extinguishes (i.e., removes) the sins
~~as water extinguishes fire, and standing in prayers by a slave of Allah
~~during the last third part of the night.'' Then he recited: "Their sides
~~forsake their beds, to invoke their Rubb in fear and hope, and they
~~spend (in charity in Allah's Cause) out of what We have bestowed on
~~them. No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward
~~for what they used to do.'' (32:17,18) Then he added, "Shall I tell you

~~replied: "Yes! Certainly, O Prophet of Allah.'' He said, "The root of
~~this matter (foundation) is Islam, its pillar (mainstay is) As-Salat
~~(the prayer) and its highest point is Jihad (fighting in the Cause of
~~Allah).'' Then he asked, "Shall I tell you of that which holds all these

~~Allah! Shall we really be accounted for what we talk about?'' He
~~replied, "May your mother lose you! People will be thrown on their faces
~~into the Hell on account of their tongues.''
# Commentary: Besides describing Articles of Islam, this Hadith mentions

~~actions can go waste if one does not guard his speech. One should,

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]
# Commentary: This Hadith tells us that the tenth day of the month of

# 1525. `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: I said to the
~~Prophet (PBUH): "Such and such thing of Safiyyah (May Allah be pleased

~~I imitated a person before him and he said, "I do not like that I should
~~imitate someone even (if I am paid) in return such and such.''
# [Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].
# Commentary: In Arabic, the word "Muhakat'' is often used for imitating
~~someone's defect or deformity, etc. Every imitation of this kind also
~~amounts to backbiting. This is the reason the Prophet (PBUH) used the
~~analogy stated in this Hadith when `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with
~~her) said that Safiyyah (May Allah be pleased with her) was short-
~~statured. Imam An-Nawawi regarded this analogy as based on Wahy and
~~supported his contention by the Verse of the Qur'an: "Nor does he speak
~~of (his own) desire. It is only a Revelation revealed.''
# Thus, it is evident from this Hadith that to speak of somebody in a
~~scornful manner, or ridicule someone's physical defect, or to imitate
~~someone's deformity, or talk disparagingly about someone, is a great
~~offense which should be avoided by every Muslim.

# Commentary: "These are the people who ate flesh of others'' is a

# Some cases where it is permissible to Backbite PageV01P1939
~~اعلم أن الغيبة تباح لغرض صحيح شرعي لا يمكن الوصول إليه إلا بها وهو ستة
~~أسباب :
# الأول التظلم فيجوز للمظلوم أن يتظلم إلى السلطان والقاضي وغيرهما ممن له
~~ولاية أو قدرة على إنصافه من ظالمه فيقول : ظلمني فلان بكذا
# الثاني الاستعانة على تغيير المنكر ورد العاصي إلى الصواب فيقول لمن يرجو
~~قدرته على إزالة المنكر : فلان يعمل كذا فازجره عنه ونحو ذلك ويكون مقصوده
~~التوصل إلى إزالة المنكر فإن لم يقصد ذلك كان حراما
# الثالث الاستفتاء فيقول للمفتي : ظلمني أبي أو أخي أو زوجي أو فلان بكذا
~~فهل له ذلك ؟ وما طريقي في الخلاص منه وتحصيل حقي ودفع الظلم ؟ ونحو ذلك
~~فهذا جائز للحاجة ولكن الأحوط والأفضل أن يقول : ما تقول في رجل أو شخص أو
~~زوج كان من أمره كذا ؟ فإنه يحصل به الغرض من غير تعيين ومع ذلك فالتعيين
~~جائز كما سنذكره في حديث هند ( انظر الحديث رقم 1532 ) إن شاء الله تعالى
# الرابع تحذير المسلمين من الشر ونصيحتهم وذلك من وجوه منها جرح المجروحين
~~من الرواة والشهود وذلك جائز بإجماع المسلمين بل واجب للحاجة . ومنها
~~المشاورة في مصاهرة إنسان أو مشاركته أو إيداعه أو معاملته أو غير ذلك أو
~~مجاورته ويجب على المشاور أن لا يخفي حاله بل يذكر المساوئ التي فيه بنية
~~النصيحة . ومنها إذا رأى متفقها يتردد إلى مبتدع أو فاسق يأخذ عنه العلم
~~وخاف أن يتضرر المتفقه بذلك فعليه نصيحته ببيان حاله بشرط أن يقصد النصيحة
~~وهذا مما يغلط فيه وقد يحمل المتكلم بذلك الحسد ويلبس الشيطان عليه ذلك
~~ويخيل إليه أنه نصيحة فليتفطن لذلك . ومنها أن يكون له ولاية لا يقوم بها
~~على وجهها إما بأن لا يكون صالحا لها وإما بأن ms328 يكون فاسقا أو مغفلا ونحو
~~ذلك فيجب ذكر ذلك لمن له عليه ولاية عامة ليزيله ويولي من يصلح أو يعلم ذلك
~~منه ليعامله بمقتضى حاله ولا يغتر به وأن يسعى في أن يحثه على الاستقامة أو
~~يستبدل به
# الخامس أن يكون مجاهرا بفسقه أو بدعته كالمجاهر بشرب الخمر ومصادرة الناس
~~وأخذ المكس وجباية الأموال ظلما وتولي الأمور الباطلة فيجوز ذكره بما يجاهر
~~به ويحرم ذكره بغيره من العيوب إلا أن يكون لجوازه سبب آخر مما ذكرناه
# السادس التعريف فإذا كان الإنسان معروفا بلقب كالأعمش والأعرج والأصم
~~والأعمى والأحول وغيرهم جاز تعريفهم بذلك ويحرم إطلاقه على جهة التنقص ولو
~~أمكن تعريفه بغير ذلك كان أولى
# فهذه ستة أسباب ذكرها العلماء وأكثرها مجمع عليه . ودلائلها من الأحاديث
~~الصحيحة المشهورة فمن ذلك :
PageV01P1940
# [Backbiting is permissible only for valid reasons approved by Shari`ah.
~~These reasons are as follows:]
# 1. It is permissible for an oppressed person to speak before the judge
~~or someone in a similar position of authority to help him or her
~~establish his or her rights by telling him `so-and-so wronged me and has
~~done such and such to me' etc.
# 2. It is permissible to seek somebody's assistance in forbidding evil
~~and helping someone change his or her immoral conduct. One can say to
~~the person who can offer such assistance, `so-and-so does such and such
~~evil deeds. Can you exhort him?' etc. This is permissible as long as one
~~intends to forbid evil. If, however, one intends something else apart
~~from this, then this act becomes unlawful.
# 3. One who seeks legal verdict on a certain matter may point out the
~~defaults of another person or relate something else. One in this case
~~can say to the Mufti (religious scholar who issues verdicts): "My father
~~or brother (for example) treated me unjustly. Can I get my right
~~established?'' etc. This is permissible to say only if need be, but it
~~is better to say `What do you think of someone who did such and such?'
~~This does not mean, however, that naming the person in question is not
~~permissible, Hadith No. 1535 makes this point clear.
# 4. One who criticizes those who openly commit acts of disobedience,
~~such as drinking wine, gambling, engaging in immoral habits,
~~fornication, hypocrisy, and making mischief.
# 5. It is permissible to call into question the narrators of Hadith,
~~and witnesses in the court when the need arises. It is also permissible
~~to mention the bad qualities of somebody for marriage purposes in case
~~an advice is sought. Also, if one has noticed that a "seeker of
~~knowledge'' frequently goes to the gatherings of an innovator in
~~religion and one fears that this "seeker of knowledge'' may be affected
~~by this so-called scholar, then he must in this case give counsel to the
~~"seeker of knowledge'' by telling him about the "innovator,'' etc.
# 6. It is permissible to use names such as "Al-a`mash'' which means
~~`the blear-eyed' to talk about people who are known by such names for
~~the sake of identification and not for disparaging people and
~~underestimating them. To identify them without resorting to such names
~~is however better.

# 1534. Zaid bin Al-Arqam (May Allah be pleased with him) said: We set

~~many hardships. `Abdullah bin Ubaiy (the chief of the hypocrites at Al-
~~Madinah) said to his friends: "Do not spend on those who are with the
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) until they desert him.'' He also said: "If we
~~return to Al-Madinah, the more honourable (meaning himself, i.e.,
~~Abdullah bin Ubaiy) will drive out therefrom the meaner (meaning
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH)).'' I went to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
~~and informed him about that and he sent someone to `Abdullah bin Ubaiy.
~~He asked him whether he had said that or not. Abdullah took an oath that
~~he had not done anything of that sort and said that it was Zaid who
~~carried a false tale to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH). Zaid said: I was
~~so much perturbed because of this until this Verse was revealed
~~verifying my statement:
# "When the hypocrites come to you (O Muhammad (PBUH)), they say: `We
~~bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allah.' Allah knows
~~that you are indeed His Messenger, and Allah bears witness that the
~~hypocrites are liars indeed.'' (63:1) Then the Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
~~called the hypocrites in order to seek forgiveness for them from Allah,
~~but they turned away their heads.
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: `Abdullah bin Ubaiy was the chief of the hypocrites at Al-
~~Madinah. In the journey mentioned in this Hadith, which was undertaken
~~in connection with the war with Banu Al-Mustaliq, he had used improper
~~words against the Prophet (PBUH) and Muslims, which were overheard by
~~Zaid bin Al-Arqam (May Allah be pleased with him). The latter informed

~~that exposing the designs and conspiracies of hypocrites does not form
~~backbiting. In fact, it is essential to keep people informed about them
~~in the interest of Islam and Muslims.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. "La yastatiru min baulihi'' has another meaning, namely: "he does
~~not pass urine in privacy but does it shamelessly in the presence of

~~will find the worst among the people a double-faced person who appears

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. "Like ores'' here signifies origin or source which will be a means
~~of honour for them. That is, the tribes which were distinguished for
~~nobility in the pre-Islamic period will also be distinguished after
~~embracing Islam. There will be no reduction in their prestige and honour
~~provided they attain true understanding of religion and adhere to its

# 2. Such people who do not have any desire for office and position are
~~most suitable for holding the reins of government. They serve the

~~responsibilities, they honestly endeavour to fulfill the trust reposed
~~in them. They keep the boundaries marked by Allah and prefer the
~~interests of the nation and their own country.
# 3. A "double-faced person'' is one who makes a group believe that he
~~is their supporter and well-wisher, but when he goes to the opposite
~~group, he tries to make them believe that he is entirely with them. The
~~best among people is one who goes to every group and earnestly tries to

~~flattering him) and he should also praise him in his absence. If the
~~ruler is bad, he should warn him of the evil consequences of his bad

~~is not present because this is the well-meaning attitude which has been

~~1546. Sumurah bin Jundub (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) very often used to ask his Companions, "Do any
~~one of you has seen a dream?'' So dreams would be narrated to him by
~~those whom Allah willed to relate. One day he (PBUH) said, "Last night I
~~had a vision in which two men (angels) came to me and woke me up and
~~said to me, `Proceed!' I set out with them and we came across a man
~~lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding
~~a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man's head, smashing
~~it. When he struck him, the stone rolled away and he went after it to
~~get it, and no sooner had he returned to this man, his head was healed
~~and restored to its former condition. The thrower (of the rock) then did
~~the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions, `Subhan-
~~Allah! Who are these?' They said: `Proceed, proceed.' So we proceeded
~~and came to a man lying in a prone position and another man standing
~~over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in
~~one side of the man's mouth and tear off that side of his face to the
~~back (of the neck), and similarly tear his nose from front to back, and
~~his eyes from front to back. Then he turned to the other side of the
~~man's face and did just as he has done with the first side. He had
~~hardly completed that (second) side when the first returned to its
~~normal state. I said to my two companions, `Subhan-Allah! Who are
~~these?' They said, `Proceed, proceed.' So we proceeded and came across
~~something like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined
~~for baking bread).'' I (the narrator) think the Prophet (PBUH) said, "In
~~that oven there was much noise and voices.'' The Prophet (PBUH) added,
~~"We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame of
~~fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them they
~~cried loudly. I asked, `Who are these?' They said to me, `Proceed,
~~proceed.' And so we proceeded and came across a river.'' I (the
~~narrator) think he said, "-- red like blood.'' The Prophet (PBUH) added,
~~"And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank
~~there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold, while the other
~~man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the
~~latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went
~~swimming again. Then again he (the former) returned to him (the latter),
~~and every time the former returned, he opened his mouth, and the latter
~~threw a stone into his mouth, (and so on) the performance was repeated.
~~I asked my two companions, `Who are these?' They replied, `Proceed,
~~proceed.' And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive
~~appearance, the most repulsive appearance you ever saw a man having!
~~Beside him there was a fire, and he was kindling it and running around
~~it. I asked my two companions, `Who is this (man).' They said to me,
~~`Proceed, proceed!' So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep
~~green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colours. In the midst
~~of the garden there was a very tall man, and I could hardly see his head
~~because of his great height, and around him there were children in such
~~a large number as I have never seen! I said to my two companions, `Who
~~is this?' They replied, `Proceed, proceed.' So we proceeded till we came
~~to a majestic, huge garden, greater and better than any garden I have
~~ever seen! My two companions said to me, `Ascend up' and I ascended
~~up.'' The Prophet (PBUH) added, "So we ascended till we reached a city
~~built of gold and silver bricks, and we went to its gate and asked (the
~~gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened; and we entered the city
~~and found in it men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the
~~most handsome person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as
~~the ugliest person you have ever seen! My two companions ordered those
~~men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river
~~flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness.
~~Those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after
~~the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared, and they came in the
~~best shape.'' The Prophet (PBUH) further added, "My two companions said
~~to me: `This place is the `Adn Jannah, and that is your place.' I raised
~~up my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two
~~companions said to me, `That palace is your place,' I said to them, `May
~~Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.' They replied, `As for now, you
~~will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day).' I said to them, `I
~~have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have
~~seen?' They replied, `We will inform you: As for the first man you came
~~upon, whose head was being smashed with the rock, he is the symbol of
~~the one who studies the Qur'an and then neither recites it nor acts on
~~its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the man
~~you came upon, whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off
~~from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his
~~house in the morning and tells lies that are spread all over the world.
~~And those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling
~~an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses. And the man who
~~was given a stone to swallow is the eater of Ar-Riba (usury), and the
~~bad-looking man whom you saw near the fire, kindling it and going around
~~it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell, and the tall man you saw in the
~~garden is (Prophet) Abraham, and the children around him are those who
~~died upon Al-Fitrah (the Islamic Faith of Monotheism).''' The narrator
~~added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet (PBUH) , "O Messenger of Allah!
~~What about the children of Al-Mushrikun (i.e., polytheists, pagans,
~~idolaters, and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah and in His Messenger
~~Muhammad (PBUH))?'' The Prophet (PBUH) replied, "And also the children
~~of Al-Mushrikun.'' The Prophet (PBUH) added: "My two companions added,
~~`The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were these people who had
~~mixed an act that was good with another that was bad, but Allah forgave
~~them'.'' Another narration of Al-Bukhari is: The Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) said, "One night two men came to me and took me to a blessed
~~land.'' (The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) told of the same incident as
~~above) and said, "After a while of walking we came upon a pit like an
~~oven, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom with fire raging in it.
~~When the flames rose up (the people in it) also rose up till they were
~~about to come out; and when the fire subsided they, too, would go down
~~with it. In it were naked men and women.'' (The remainder of the Hadith
~~is the same as the above Hadith except that at the end of it, the
~~Messenger of Allah said: "We came upon a river of blood in the middle of
~~which there was a man standing, and at the bank of the river there was a
~~man with plenty of stones before him...'' In this narration we also
~~find: "They made me climb the tree and they made me enter an abode so
~~beautiful the like of which I have never seen before. There (I saw) old
~~men and youth.'' In this narration we also find: "`The first house you
~~entered was the abode of the believers in general, and the other house
~~was the abode of the martyrs. I am Jibril (Gabriel), and this is
~~Mika'il. Raise your head.' I looked up and saw something like clouds.
~~They said to me, `That is your abode.' I said, `Shall I enter it?' They
~~said, `You have not completed your term of life yet. When you do, you
~~will certainly enter it.''' [Al-Bukhari] Commentary: This Hadith has the
~~following points: 1. Manifestation through dream of punishment of
~~various evils, i.e., forgetting the Qur'an after having memorized it,
~~not practising the teachings of the Qur'an, violating the precepts of
~~the Qur'an after attaining their knowledge, slackness in offering
~~obligatory Salat, lying, immoral acts, usury, etc. Strict warnings have
~~been issued against all these evils, and the punishment to which they
~~are liable have been mentioned in this Hadith. May Allah save us from
~~them. 2. This Hadith also mentions the unique status of Prophet (PBUH)
~~and the distinguished place of martyrs. 3. We also learn from this
~~Hadith that Allah has made Hell for punishment and Jannah for reward.
~~Muhammad (PBUH), the Last Prophet of Allah, was made to witness many
~~scenes which demonstrated the retribution and reward of deeds done by
~~people in their earthly life.

# The learned compiler of this book has put forth some arguments to
~~prove that it is lawful to tell a lie under the stress of circumstances.
~~An example of this is the case of a Muslim who hides himself or his
~~money from a tyrant who is bent on killing him or taking his money from
~~him. If one knows the whereabouts of this Muslim or his money and is
~~asked about it, it is permissible to lie in this case to save a Muslim's

~~is one which is not clear or definite in meaning, and that can be
~~interpreted in more than one way in order to shun lying altogether. The
~~sum and substance of discussion has been derived from the narration
~~ascribed to Umm Kulthum (May Allah be pleased with her). She said: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "A liar is not the one who tries to
~~bring about a reconciliation between the people and speaks good to avert
~~dispute or to convey good.''
# [Al-Bukhari].
# It may be concluded that falsehood is permissible in the following
~~three cases:
# (i) While fighting Jihad in the Cause of Allah.
# (ii) To conciliate between people.
# (iii) For the husband to please his wife and the wife to please her

# Commentary: Some people disguise themselves as pious to create a false

# 1558. Abu Barzah Nadlah bin `Ubaid Al-Aslami (May Allah be pleased

~~the luggage of people. Suddenly she saw the Prophet (PBUH). The pass of
~~the mountain became narrow for her people (because of fear). The young
~~woman said to the she-camel: "Go ahead.'' When it did not move, she
~~said, "O Allah! Curse it.'' The Prophet (PBUH) said, "The she-camel that
~~has been cursed should not accompany us.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: Some people have taken this Hadith to mean that the she-
~~camel cursed by the young woman was abandoned there and it was neither
~~used for transport nor conveyance, as was the practice in the pre-
~~Islamic period with she-camels which were let loose for free pasture for
~~the polytheists' false gods, and nothing was allowed to be carried on
~~them. Such she-camels were called as "As-Sa'ibah'' There is no
~~justification for such interpretation because the she-camel was not set
~~absolutely free like As-Sa'ibah. All that was done was that because of
~~the curse, it was considered unworthy of the entourage company of the
~~Prophet (PBUH). Except for this bar, it was valid for all other
~~purposes. Thus, this Hadith proves that it is not permissible to
~~associate with people who are given to sins and heresies in religion
~~because they have been cursed. When one is not permitted to keep an
~~animal which has been cursed, how can one possibly keep company with
~~people who commit acts as a result of which they have been cursed.

~~(disobedience of Allah) and killing him is (tantamount to) disbelief.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].

~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) saying, "When any Muslim accuses another
~~Muslim of sin or of disbelief, the reproach rebounds upon the one who
~~utters it, if the other person is not deserving of it.''
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: What this Hadith stresses is that one should never say
~~about a Muslim that he is sinful (Fasiq) or disbeliever (Kafir) when he
~~is not so. The reason is that in that case, one who says it, will be
~~held Fasiq or Kafir. One should, therefore, strictly refrain from
~~uttering such statements.

~~of Allah (PBUH) said, "When two persons indulge in abusing each other,
~~the beginner will be the sinner so long as the oppressed does not
~~transgress the limits.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith tells us that if a Muslim abuses another and
~~says unfair things about him and in return the recipient also abuses him
~~and says unfair things to the same extent, then the entire burden of sin
~~of abusing would lie with the person who initiated the quarrel. But if
~~the one who is wronged, exceeds the limits in revenge, then he will also
~~be guilty to the degree of his excess. Thus, this Hadith shows that
~~although revenge is permissible in Islam, it is better to forgive and
~~bear the excess with patience. The reason behind this is that in
~~revenge, one usually exceeds the limits and becomes an aggressor. Allah
~~says: "And verily, whosoever shows patience and forgives, that would
~~truly be from the things recommended by Allah.'' (42:43).

~~تقولوا هذا لا تعينوا عليه الشيطان ] رواه البخاري
# 1562. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: A drunkard
~~was brought to the Prophet (PBUH). He said, "Give him a beating.'' Then
~~some beat him with their hands, some with their shoes, and some with (a
~~folded) piece of cloth. When he left, someone said to him: "May Allah
~~disgrace you!'' The Prophet (PBUH) said, "Do not help Satan overcome him
~~by uttering such words.''
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: We learn from this Hadith that imprecation against a
~~sinner helps Satan because he is avowed to disgrace and humiliate
~~Muslims before Allah. When a Muslim curses another Muslim and imprecates
~~for his humiliation and disgrace, he in fact tries to accomplish the
~~mission of Satan because in doing so Satan will have achieved his
~~objective. Therefore, one should not curse a fellow Muslim even if he or
~~she is a sinner. In fact, one should pray to Allah for his or her
~~guidance.

~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) saying, "He who accuses his slave of Zina will
~~receive the punishment (Hadd) of slander on the Day of Resurrection,
~~unless the accusation of Zina was true.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: On the Day of Judgement, the masters of slaves and slave-
~~girls will be exposed to Hadd-ul-Qadfi (Hadd for accusing someone of
~~adultery) for the reason that they perpetrate all kinds of oppressions
~~on their captives and their grievances are not redressed. On the Day of
~~Judgement, when Almighty Allah dispenses justice without any prejudice
~~and favour, He will also do full justice to this oppressed class and
~~those masters, who somehow escaped the punishment on this account in
~~this world. Thus, this Hadith has a stern warning for those masters who
~~are carried away by their might and authority and perpetrate oppression
~~on their servants and slaves.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: Everyone who professes Tauhid and acknowledges the
~~Prophethood of Muhammad (PBUH), is a Muslim, but a perfect Muslim is one
~~who has attained that high level where he does not harm any Muslim with
~~his hand and tongue (speech). Similarly, an Emigrant is the one who
~~abandons his homeland and relatives and goes to a place where he can
~~easily practise the religion of Allah. But such a person is also an
~~Emigrant who renounces all such things which are forbidden by Allah,
~~because emigration means abandoning, whether it is abandoning of

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith is part of a long Hadith which has already
~~been mentioned. See Hadith No.
# 668. It stresses steadfastness in Faith and virtuous deeds because the
~~time of death is not known to anyone. Since one can die at any moment,
~~one should never be unmindful of the obligations of Faith and good deeds
~~so that he embraces death in a state of perfect Faith. This Hadith has
~~the same meanings which are contained in the Verse 102 of the Surat
~~Al-`Imran exhorting the Muslims thus: "And die not except in a state of
~~Islam [(as Muslim) with complete submission to Allah].''
# Every Muslim should treat people as nicely as he himself desires to be

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: "Do not harbour grudge against one another'' means that
~~one should not say or do any thing which is likely to create ill-will
~~and hatred in others. "Nor jealousy'' signifies that if a Muslim is
~~granted any blessing by Allah, one should not wish that he be deprived
~~of it. "Do not show your backs to one another'' means that if you come
~~across one another, exchange salutations rather than avoid each other.
~~Since all such things create conflict and dissension, these are strictly

# 1570. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) said, "Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the worst
~~of false tales. Do not look for other's faults. Do not spy one another,
~~and do not practise Najsh (means to offer a high price for something in
~~order to allure another customer who is interested in the thing). Do not
~~be jealous of one another and do not nurse enmity against one another.
~~Do not sever ties with one another. Become the slaves of Allah, and be
~~brothers to one another as He commanded. A Muslim is the brother of a
~~Muslim. He should neither oppress him nor humiliate him. The piety is
~~here! The piety is here!'' While saying so he pointed towards his chest.
~~"It is enough evil for a Muslim to look down upon his Muslim brother.
~~All things of a Muslim are inviolable for his brother in Faith: his
~~blood, his wealth and his honour. Verily, Allah does not look to your
~~bodies nor to your faces but He looks to your hearts and your deeds.''
# Another narration is: "Do not feel envy against one another; do not
~~nurse enmity; do not spy on one another and do not cheat one another. Be
~~Allah's slaves, brethren to one another.''
# Another narration is: "Do not have estranged relations with one
~~another. Do not nurse enmity and do not feel envy against one another. O
~~Allah's worshippers! Be brothers!''
# Another narration is: "Do not estrange mutual relations and do not
~~intervene into the transaction which is likely to be settled with
~~another person.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: "Beware of suspicion'' means such suspicion about a Muslim
~~for which no apparent evidence is available. Similar is the case of that
~~thought which emerges in one's mind without any logic. "Najsh'' means to
~~give higher bid in auction only to deceive others. Thus, it is a false
~~bid which is not at all intended for purchasing the thing which is being
~~auctioned. The instructions given to the Muslims in this Hadith are
~~meant to secure the honour of Muslims. Since, doubt without any reason,
~~and search for defects and weaknesses go against the security of a
~~Muslim's honour, Islam has strictly forbidden Muslims from them. Another
~~purpose for forbidding such things is to consolidate Muslim brotherhood.
~~For this reason, they have been forbidden from oppression, leaving their
~~Muslim brothers in lurch, considering others humble, and from taking
~~pride in worldly possessions. In fact, the life, property, and honour of
~~a Muslim have been declared unlawful for all other Muslims. Increase in
~~a bid without any intention of buying the thing being auctioned and
~~bargain over a bargain have also been prohibited because they also
~~create ill-will and enmity.

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith has already been mentioned (Hadith No. 216).
~~Imam An-Nawawi has interpreted the words "Batar-ul-Haq'' as "Daf`-ul-
~~Haq'' that is to evade the truth and return it to the person who says
~~it, which practically means evasion. To dress well does not come in the
~~category of pride, as people generally consider it. In fact, pride
~~constitutes what is mentioned in this Hadith.

~~The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Once someone said: `By Allah! Allah

# 1. Since Islam is a religion based on the nature of man, it has a

~~of friendship, Muslims have been ordered not to let this temporary
~~unpleasantness and turbidity go beyond a period of three days.

# قال أبو داود : إذا كانت الهجرة لله تعالى فليس من هذا في شيء
# 1597. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) said, "It is not permissible for a believer to forsake
~~his (Muslim) brother for more than three days. If three days have
~~passed, he should meet him and greet him; and if other responds to it
~~they will both share the reward; but if he does not respond, he will
~~bear his sin and the one who (has taken the initiative to) greet (the
~~other) will be absolved of the sin of forsaking (one's brother in
~~Faith).''
# [Abu Dawud].
# Commentary:
# 1. Contact and speech with people should be for the Pleasure of Allah
~~only. For instance, if somebody is a heretic in religion, or commits
~~sins openly, and in spite of the advice given to him, he does not mend
~~his way, a Muslim can renounce contact with him for the sake of Allah.
~~Such renunciation is permissible. In fact, it is desirable so that he
~~may learn a lesson from it and may change himself. But severing contacts
~~merely for worldly grievances is not permissible.
# 2. After three days, one who should take the initiative in giving
~~Salam is more superior than the other. If the second party does not
~~respond and perpetuates malice and enmity, he will be sinful and the
~~former will be absolved of the sin of rupturing contact.

~~four and said to me and the man he had called: Move away a bit because I

~~not hold secret counsel together excluding the third.''
# Commentary: This Hadith teaches us certain etiquettes of society. Ibn
~~`Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) called the fourth person so that
~~he (Ibn `Umar) could hear the conversation of the man who wanted to
~~speak to him in isolation. He asked the other two to move to a distance
~~so that they could not overhear what the person in question wanted to
~~say to him. Thus, we learn that in the presence of more than one person,
~~two can speak to each other in confidence. If there are four people,
~~three of them are not permitted to speak in confidence leaving the
~~fourth alone. Moreover, this prohibition is for lawful matters only
~~because in unlawful matters such private conversation is altogether
~~forbidden, even if there is no third person. The Noble Qur'an ordains:
# "O you who believe! When you hold secret counsel, do it not for sin
~~and wrong and disobedience to the Messenger, but do it for righteousness

~~their heads. He said: "What is the matter?'' He was told that they had

~~Hisham said: "I bear testimony to the fact that I heard the Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) saying, `Allah will torment those who torment people in the
~~world.''' Then he proceeded towards their Amir and reported this Hadith
~~to him. The Amir then issued orders for their release.
# [Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. "Al-Kharaj'' is that tax which is charged on the produce yielded by
~~land which is in the possession of non-Muslims in a Muslim State, while
~~the revenue that is recovered from the Muslims on the lands held by them
~~is called "Al-Ushr''. "Jizyah'' is that annual fee which is charged from
~~the non-Muslims for the safety and security provided to their life,
~~property and honour by a Muslim State. Muslims pay Zakat and non-Muslims
~~pay Jizyah.
# 2. "Adhab'' torment is that particular punishment which Allah will
~~inflict upon the inhabitants of Hell. If anyone gives a similar
~~punishment to anybody in this world, he will be punished by Allah in the
~~Hereafter for it, because He does not like anyone to do so. To make
~~someone stand in a sizzling hot day and pour oil over his head is one
~~type of tormenting people. For this reason, Hisham bin Hakim (May Allah

~~and make him abolish the punishment.
# 3. We also learn from this Hadith that it is incumbent on every Muslim

~~Riba. So whosoever receives an admonition from his Rubb and stops eating
~~Ar-Riba, shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allah (to
~~judge); but whoever returns (to Ar-Riba), such are the dwellers of the
~~Fire - they will abide therein. Allah will destroy Ar-Riba and will give
~~increase for Sadaqat (deeds of charity, alms). And Allah likes not the

~~they will have their reward with their Rubb. On them shall be no fear,
~~nor shall they grieve. O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up

~~الله عليه وسلم آكل الربا وموكله . رواه مسلم
# زاد الترمذي وغيره : وشاهديه وكاتبه
# 1615. `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:
~~The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) cursed the one who accepts Ar-Riba (the
~~usury) and the one who pays it.
# [Muslim].
# The narration in At-Tirmidhi adds: And the one who records it, and the
~~two persons who stand witness to it.
# Commentary: Both the parties, that is the one who charges interest and
~~the one who pays it, are equally guilty in the matter of usury (or
~~Riba). This Hadith highlights the intensity of unlawfulness of Ar-Riba,
~~or what has come to be called nowadays interest which can be judged from
~~the fact that not only the person who charges it and the one who pays it
~~are cursed but even those who write the documents and bear witness to
~~the transaction are condemned although the latter two have no active
~~part in the deal. They have been condemned for their mere co-operation
~~in the matter of interest. Thus, we learn that even co-operation in the
~~deal in which interest is involved is an invitation to the Curse and
~~Wrath of Allah. The reason for such severity in the matter of interest
~~is that Islam wants to create a society which is founded on fraternity,
~~sympathy, selflessness and sacrifice. If someone is in need of money,
~~the rich should fulfill his needs for the sake of Allah's Pleasure or
~~give him a loan without interest. As against the Islamic system, this
~~system of interest is based on selfishness, exploitation and
~~suppression. In the interest-ridden societies, the affluent ones are not
~~inclined to co-operate with the needy for the sake of Allah. All they
~~are concerned with is their own interest. Their lust and greed are not
~~reduced in the slightest measure even after draining the last drop of
~~the blood of the poor. This is the reason why Shari`ah has forbidden
~~interest of every kind and regarded it unlawful, no matter whether the
~~loan is for the personal need or commercial requirements.
# Some people say that there did not exist any practice of commercial
~~loan in Arabia at that time and people used to borrow money for their
~~personal needs only. On the basis of this plea, they say that the
~~interest which has been forbidden by Islam relates to the latter form.
~~For this reason, they hold that interest lawful which is charged on loan
~~taken for industry and commerce. They contend that since the borrowers
~~in industrial and commercial sectors make huge profits from such loans,
~~how does it become unlawful if they pay the lender a small fixed annual
~~amount against it? In their opinion, it is a right of the lender which
~~should be paid to him on his wealth. But such arguments are totally
~~wrong for two major reasons:
# First, the assumption that there was no practice of commercial loans
~~in Arabia is altogether baseless. Commercial loan was certainly in vogue
~~in the Arab society and there is no point in debating this fact.
# Second, nobody can say with certainty that the amount invested by a
~~person in business will yield profit without fail because we see it
~~every day that sometimes huge investments made in business and industry
~~result in colossal loss, but the lending agency does not bother about it
~~at all and it recovers from the borrower every penny of his loan and
~~interest. Is this not the height of tyranny and selfishness? If it is
~~supposed that there is no loss, even then the interest on loan
~~substantially contributes to the increase in prices of goods. Whatever
~~interest an industrialist pays on loan is added to the cost of his
~~goods, which ultimately increases their prices and in turn adversely
~~affects the purchasing capacity of the customers - the masses. This is
~~the reason why Islam has closed this largest source of exploitation,
~~suppression and tyranny by declaring every kind of interest unlawful.
# It is very sad indeed that in emulating the western societies, Muslims
~~have also founded their economy on the system of interest. The
~~westernized rulers of the Muslim countries are not making any effort to
~~emancipate their countries from this curse, nor do the people of these
~~countries now have any passion to save themselves from it. In fact, a
~~large majority of them borrow and lend money on interest through the
~~bank without any regard to the Islamic injunctions in this respect.
# Given below are some points for the consideration of those Muslims who
~~want to protect their Faith and religion and save themselves from the
~~curse of interest.
# The word used for interest in the Qur'an is Ar-Riba which means
~~excess. In Shari`ah, it is the measure of excess in one thing when two
~~things are exchanged in some bargain; or in the case of a loan, an
~~increased amount of the loan at the time of its payment. Ar-Riba is of
~~two kinds:
# First, Riba Al-Fadl: To take more in exchange of one commodity in the
~~event of barter of two similar commodities.
# Second, Riba An-Nasi'ah: To take a larger return of one thing while
~~two identical things are bartered. But in this case the larger return is
~~effected after a fixed period of time.
# In Islamic jurisprudence, assets are of two types. One type is of
~~commodities and the other is of the mode of price for exchanging
~~commodities called Thaman Then every type has a class of varieties. For
~~example, food grains are a type of assets and rice, wheat, etc., are its
~~varieties. Similarly, silver, gold, etc., are varieties of the second
~~type of assets. Coins, currency notes, company shares, etc., can also be
~~considered varieties of this type in contemporary life.
# This Hadith has injunctions in respect of both types of assets. Six
~~things mentioned in the Hadith are gold, silver, wheat, barley, dates
~~and salt. Some religious scholars have restricted the matters relating
~~to interest to these six things only and do not regard increase or
~~decrease in other things as usury, while going by analogy the majority
~~of scholars and jurists have included other things also in this list.
~~(For instance, all the food grains whether they are calculated in terms
~~of weight or measure, or which have - like gold and silver - the quality
~~of being Thaman, or according to some scholars and jurists which are
~~capable of being stored).
# Thus, to sum up, these two types of assets have four varieties:
# 1. Commodities which are sold by weight.
# 2. Commodities which are sold by measure.
# 3. Commodities which can be stored.
# 4. Commodities which are used as Thaman in sale and purchase.
# In all such matters the position of interest-bearing and interest-free
~~things would be as under:
# 1. When commodities to be exchanged are of the same `type' and
~~`variety,' any increase or decrease in them will be unlawful, as will be
~~their sale on credit; for example, exchange of wheat with wheat and rice
~~with rice. It is essential that these things are equal in measure and/or
~~weight, and are in actual possession.
# 2. If two things to be exchanged are of the same `type' but of a
~~different `variety,' any increase or decrease in them is permissible.
~~Their sale on credit is, however, not lawful. For instance, the exchange
~~of one kilogram of silver with two grams of gold, or the barter of one
~~kilo barley with half a kilo wheat, or the exchange of one dinar with
~~four riyals. If such a bargain is on cash basis it will be fair, but any
~~credit in this case is not correct.
# 3. When the two things to be exchanged are not of the same `type' and
~~are also different in `variety,' then any increase or decrease in them
~~is permissible and their sale on credit is also allowed. For example,
~~exchange of one kilogramme of wheat with a gram of gold, bargain of one
~~kilogramme of dates with ten Tola (about 116 grams) silver. Any increase
~~or decrease in them is permissible, as is their sale on credit

# [ الحمو ] : قريب الزوج كأخيه وابن أخيه وابن عمه
# 1628. `Uqbah bin `Amir (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Avoid (entering a place) in which are
~~women (uncovered or simply to mix with them in seclusion).'' A man from
~~the Ansar said, "Tell me about the brother of a woman's husband.'' He
~~replied, "The brother of a woman's husband is death.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith tells us an extremely important point in
~~respect of the veil about which the majority of Muslims are unaware or
~~negligent. The point that it tells us that a woman must observe the veil
~~from the real brothers, cousins etc., of her husband because their
~~visits in her home are very frequent and there may occur several
~~occasions when they come across each other alone. For this reason, there
~~are greater chances of mischief with them. This explains why the
~~husband's male relatives have been regarded as "death'', that is from
~~the religious point of view they are fatal. In other words, if they
~~commit the mischief, it will prove fatal because in an Islamic state
~~this crime is punishable by Rajm (stoning to death). This can also be
~~fatal in another way. If the husband begins to suspect that his wife has
~~illicit relations with someone else, he might kill her or divorce her
~~out of his sense of honour. Even in case of divorce, her life will
~~become desolate. Another meaning of it can be that one should be as much
~~afraid of meeting such women in seclusion with whom any kind of contact
~~is not permissible as one is afraid of death.
# When a woman is required to observe the veil from the real brothers of
~~her husband, why would it not be essential to observe the veil from the
~~husband's friends. Slackness in this matter is also very common
~~nowadays. Although the dangerous consequences of this fashion come to
~~our notice everyday through newspapers, people do not learn any lesson
~~from them, and the fashion of non-observance of the veil is spreading
~~fast like an epidemic. May Allah save us from this evil!

~~who strive hard and fight in the way of Allah) for those who remain at
~~home (i.e., those who do not go to the battlefield to fight Jihad) is
~~like the sanctity of their own mothers. Anyone who remains behind to
~~look after the family of a Mujahid and betrays his trust, will be made
~~to stand on the Day of Resurrection before the Mujahid who will take
~~away from his meritorious deeds whatever he likes till he is
~~satisfied.'' The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) turned toward us and said,
~~"Now, what do you think (i.e., will he leave anything with him)?''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: The protection and supervision of the families of those
~~Mujahidun who go to Jihad, is an act of high merit, and if someone
~~violates the trust reposed in him, he will be committing a grave sin
~~indeed. Such breach of trust shakes the very structure of mutual
~~cooperation which has a singular importance in Islam. This Hadith
~~considers the act of those who violate the Mujahidun's trust by
~~molesting their wives in any way, taking advantage of their absence, as
~~a very grave sin, because Mujahidun defend the Faith and strive hard to
~~raise the flag of Islam high. Those who commit such a grave sin will be

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith has the following three important points:

# Commentary: Ja`far was the cousin of the Prophet (PBUH) and he was
~~martyred in the battle of Mu'tah. Although martyrdom is an honour but
~~even then the bereaved family does feel the shock of the loss. For this
~~reason, the Prophet (PBUH) permitted them to give vent to their grief
~~for three days. It should not, however, be taken to mean that he allowed

~~performed (in the past) by piercing needle in some part of the body for
~~drawing blood and then filling the cavity caused by it with antimony,
~~indigo, etc., to make the spot green or black. This is called tattooing.
~~In the Arab society of the Prophet's time, this fashion was very popular
~~among women for enhancing their charms and beauty in the same way as the
~~fashion of patching someone's hair with his own. Al-Mustaushima is a
~~woman who asks some women for tattooing and/or a woman who marks tattoos
~~on the skin of another woman.
# As this act amounts to changing the natural appearance of a person,
~~both women, that is the one who subjects her body to tattooing and the
~~one who makes this operation, are cursed. Such fashions are in vogue in
~~this age also. Plucking the eyelashes and filling them with colours and
~~other material of make up, or like Hindu women, making mark between the

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: "Bewailing'' is wailing over the dead. It is weeping

~~over his death and they do it despite his warning against doing so, then
~~the deceased will not suffer any torment on their wailing because his

# Commentary: Kahin (soothsayer), Munajjim (astrologer) and Arraf
~~(foreteller) have similar characteristics but with a slight difference.
~~All of them make predictions about the future. Kahin would overhear some
~~jinn and disclose the secret to people which would sometimes prove true,
~~because the jinn's source of information was Satan who sometimes stole
~~away some information from the angels. But after the annunciation of the
~~Prophet (PBUH) it was made impossible for jinns and satans to overhear
~~anything in the skies. Moreover, Kahin and others of his ilk would make
~~predictions on the basis of certain signs and circumstantial evidence
~~which could go wrong or right. This is so even to this day. Astrological
~~prediction is also a form of foretelling but this is often wrong.
~~Al-`Irafah, or what is known to be as divination is also an indication
~~of some future occurrence on the basis of certain causes and events. All
~~the three occult arts supplement each other and also take the help of
~~similar other things. In other words, these are all different forms of
~~soothsaying. Geomancy also tries to tell about the invisible future. At-
~~Tarq is the art of taking omen by striking birds with gravel on their
~~wings or by throwing barley, etc., before them. In the latter formula,
~~if a bird flies towards the right side, it would be a good omen; and if
~~it goes towards the left it will be a bad one. All such things are
~~unlawful and have been strictly forbidden by Islam. If anything

# Commentary: Iyafah is an occult practice in which the practitioner
~~rapidly draws lines on the soft ground in the presence of his client in
~~such a manner that the lines cannot be counted then he effaces the lines
~~in pairs. If at the end of the exercise two lines are left on the
~~ground, it is taken as a good omen; if it is a single line, it is a bad
~~omen. Some people have also described certain other forms of this occult
~~formula. In any case, it was one of the formulas practised by the
~~soothsayers of the Period of Ignorance. This practice, like others of
~~this kind, was prohibited and Muslims were made to understand that such
~~things could neither benefit nor harm anyone, and were mere tricks and
~~frauds; and any reliance on them was absolute superstition and heresy.
~~How sad it is that a large number of Muslims of the present age have
~~faith in such occult practices and believe in superstitions. May Allah
~~grant us guidance and save us from such evils. Al-Jibt covers a wide
~~meanings. It means anything worshipped other than the true God (Allah),
~~i.e., all false deities, be they an idol, Satan, graves, stars, angels,
~~saints, Jesus the son of Mary, etc.

# 1672. Mu`awiyah bin Al-Hakam (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:
~~I said: "O Messenger of Allah, I have recently emerged from ignorance
~~and Allah has favoured me with Islam. There are still some men among us
~~who visit the soothsayers to consult them (on matters relating to the
~~future).'' He (PBUH) replied, "Do not visit them.'' I said: "There are
~~some men who are guided by omens.'' He replied, "These are the ideas
~~which come up in their minds but you should not be influenced by them
~~(i.e., these things) should not prevent them from pursuing their
~~works.'' I said: "There are some men who practise divination by drawing
~~lines on the ground.'' The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) replied, "There was
~~a Prophet who drew lines, the line which agrees with the line drawn by
~~that Prophet would be correct.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. This Hadith has already appeared earlier [Hadith No 701]. "These
~~are the ideas which come up in their minds'' means that sometimes
~~something appears and one's mind at once takes it as a bad omen. This is
~~something instinctive and natural and one is not accountable for it. But
~~if one acts in accordance with that omen then what he does is wrong and
~~is, therefore, forbidden. For this reason, the Prophet (PBUH) said,
~~"(i.e., these things) should not prevent them from pursuing their
~~works.''
# 2. The drawing of a line mentioned in this Hadith is different from
~~the drawing of lines in `Iyafah mentioned earlier. Moreover, that was an
~~act of a Prophet which was done by him in the light of Wahy sent to him
~~by Allah and, therefore, was certainly correct. But now, nobody
~~possesses that knowledge and cannot, therefore, be adopted. The
~~statement of the Prophet (PBUH) that: "The line which agrees with the
~~line drawn by that Prophet would be correct'' was by way of elucidation.
~~It does not mean that that act can also be done by anyone today, for how
~~can it be done without knowing its principles. How did that Prophet of
~~Allah draw that line? What were its principles? Since that knowledge has
~~passed away with that Prophet, it is now no longer valid, nor would it
~~be fruitful.
# Who was the Prophet who did it? Some people say it was Prophet Daniyal
~~(Daniel), while other think it was Prophet Idris. Allah Alone knows the truth.

# 1673. Abu Mas`ud Al-Badri (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) prohibited the price of a dog, the earning of
~~an prostitute, and the money given to a soothsayer.
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. "Prohibition of the price of dog'' signifies that the sale and
~~purchase of dogs is forbidden. This a general order which applies to dog
~~of every kind, whether it is for hunting or protection of farms (which
~~is permissible) or is a tamed one. The reason being that dog is an
~~absolutely unclean animal no matter what breed it is. Some `Ulama' are
~~of the opinion that the sale and purchase of such dog which one intends
~~to keep for lawful needs such as hunting and protecting farms is
~~permissible. So far as reasoning is concerned, the views of the majority
~~of `Ulama' are quite strong because we find absolute prohibition of dogs
~~in this Hadith.
# The earning of a vile woman has been called `Dower' in the Hadith
~~because of its evident form, otherwise it is unlawful and nobody accepts
~~its justification. Similar is the case of soothsayers, astrologers,
~~fortunetellers and all those who fool people by telling them about
~~future and thus swindle money from them. Their income is also unlawful.
# 2. It is also unlawful to make any payment to such swindlers because
~~when it is not lawful for them to make money in this manner, how can we
~~consider the money given to them lawful?

~~وسلم : [ لا عدوى ولا طيرة ويعجبني الفأل ] قالوا : وما الفأل ؟ قال : [
~~كلمة طيبة ] متفق عليه. Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Not the transmission of disease of one
~~person to another and no evil omen, but I am pleased with good omens.''
~~He was asked: "What is good omen?'' He replied, "A good word.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. The phrase "Not the transmission of disease of one person to
~~another'' either negates the idea that disease can travel from one
~~person to another or it signifies that one should not attribute the
~~illness of one person to the illness of another. The right approach is
~~that one should think that a person falls ill with the Will of Allah.
~~This does not mean that this Hadith denies the infectious character of
~~certain diseases but it attempts to correct one's belief, namely that if
~~Allah wills something, it will certainly occur. Thus, this Hadith proves
~~that even in infectious diseases it is not the disease itself which is
~~the real cause but the Preordainment and Will of Allah.
# 2. Similar is the case of bad omens. These have no significance at
~~all. If any suspicion crosses one's mind by seeing something, he should
~~neither attach any importance to it nor act what the suspicion demands.
~~Good omen is permissible for the reason that it inclines one to
~~associate good hopes with Allah, which is a highly commendable tendency.
~~Thus, it also induces one to always utter something nice and to listen
~~to what is nice so that in both cases it occasions good omens. One
~~should always abstain from saying what is repulsive to the listeners and
~~tends to be a bad omen.

~~of Allah (PBUH) said, "There is no infection and no evil omen; but if
~~there is anything (that may be a source of trouble) then it could be a
~~house, a horse, and a woman.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This Hadith means that nothing is ominous by itself. It
~~is, however, true that because of their certain characteristics, certain
~~things become ominous (troublesome) for certain persons. For example, if
~~one has a small house or bad neighbours, he does not feel happy and
~~peaceful in it. If one's wife is sterile or rude or abusive or immoral,
~~etc., such a woman is ominous for him, that is, she is a source of
~~trouble and tension rather than that of happiness for him. If one has a
~~horse which is not used for Jihad, or is so ill-natured that it neither
~~goes well ordinarily or with whipping, nor does it behave when left to
~~its own will, then it has an ominousness in the sense that it does not
~~serve the purpose of the master.

~~power but in You).'''
# [Abu Dawud with Sahih Isnad].
# Commentary:
# 1. Tiyarah means taking omen. This applies to good as well as bad
~~omens. Muslims are required to take good omen only. For this reason,
~~when a Muslim resolves to do something good then a bad omen should not
~~impede his way because he believes that it is Allah Alone who brings
~~about every thing. He should also pray to Allah for the removal of
~~mischief.
# 2. When such things from which people usually take a bad omen create
~~suspicions in one's mind, then it is Mustahabb (desirable) to recite the
~~prayer mentioned in this Hadith. Thus, what we learn from this Hadith is
~~that if a Muslim comes across something repulsive, he should pray to
~~Allah for something auspicious. He should also pray to Allah for
~~granting him the power and ability to abstain from evils.

# Commentary:
# 1. We learn from these Ahadith that it is permissible to keep dogs for
~~hunting and security of herds and farms but not for any other purpose.
~~If anyone does so, he will be losing a Qirat or two from his rewards
~~everyday. Why did the Prophet (PBUH) use the words Qirat or two Qirat?
~~Some scholars say that at first the Prophet (PBUH) said one and
~~subsequently increased the number. Some scholars hold that the
~~difference of one and two relates to urban and rural areas. The
~~inhabitants of cities would be losing two Qirat from their rewards
~~daily, while in case of villagers this loss will be one Qirat only,
~~because they stand in greater need of dogs.
# 2. Why does the reduction in reward take place? In response to this
~~question, it has been stated that it is very difficult to escape from
~~the filth of dogs and sometimes it adversely effects even Salat and
~~reduces their reward. Some scholars say that since dogs are apt to bark
~~on guests and beggars and scare them, the tension caused by this affects
~~the reward of the host. Allah Alone knows the truth of the matter.
# What is Qirat? It is differently interpreted. There is a Qirat which
~~is mentioned in the funeral prayer. This is equal to the Uhud mountain.
~~Does it signify the same here? Some scholars answer this question in the
~~affirmative while others hold that in the funeral prayer it occurs with
~~reference to Allah's Mercy and Grace but here it relates to His Wrath.
~~As the former is far greater than the latter, the word cannot have the

~~and it stinks. When such animals are disgusting for riding, they would
~~be obviously unlawful for food. It is, however, necessary that the Al-
~~Jallalah should have the characteristic mentioned in the Hadith because

# Commentary: Khabith generally means impure, base and wicked, but it is

# 2. We also learn from this Hadith that mosques should be kept free

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: What we learn from this Hadith is that if a person has
~~taken an oath to do something but subsequently realizes that it is
~~better to forego the oath, he should expiate for the oath rather than
~~sticking to it because it is easier to expiate for the oath than to
~~suffer a loss, be it in religion or otherwise.

# 1718. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) said, "Persistence in respect of his oath about his
~~family is more sinful with Allah than the payment of its expiation
~~prescribed by Allah.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. "Ahl'' means wife, children and other members of one's family. For
~~example, if a man takes an oath regarding some matter relating to his
~~wife, although the act he has forbidden himself is better for him, it
~~will be sinful to stick to the oath. Far less than this sin would be the
~~breaking of the oath to normalize his relation with his wife and
~~children. The essence of all these Ahadith is that if one comes to
~~realize that, after taking an oath, his oath was wrong, then he must
~~break the oath and do what he had vowed not to do. There are different
~~forms of breaking the oaths. For instance, if one has taken an oath that
~~he will drink alcohol, it will be obligatory for him to break his oath.
~~Or if one takes an oath to not to do a thing which is desirable, or
~~taken an oath to do something which is not desirable, then it will be
~~desirable to break the oath. Similarly, if one takes an oath to not to
~~do something permissible then the act of breaking the oath will also
~~come in the category of permissible.
# 2. The expiation of an oath is necessary. This can be done by means of
~~feeding ten poor persons, or by providing clothes to a similar number of
~~persons, or by setting a slave free. If one does not have the capacity
~~to do any of the three acts, then he should observe fast for three days..
# 3. If, in spite of realizing that the act one has vowed not to do is
~~better, one still sticks to his oath, he would be then more sinful.
# 4. The teachings and practices of the Prophet (PBUH) tell us that to
~~adopt the better course is preferable to sticking to the oath.

# 1719. `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Ayah:
~~"Allah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths ...''
~~was revealed in respect of those persons who are in the habit of
~~repeating: `No, by Allah'; and `Yes, by Allah.'
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary:
# 1. From the previous as well as present chapter we learn that there
~~are three kinds of oaths:
# First, false oath (Al-Yamin Al-Ghamus).
# Second, absurd (Laghw) oath, which is neither sinful nor is there any
~~expiation for its violation.
# Third, Al-Mu`aqqadah. It is an oath which one takes wholeheartedly for
~~doing or not doing anything. It is liable for expiation if one violates
~~it. Its expiation is mentioned in this Hadith.
# 2. What will be the quantity of the average food that is to be served
~~to the ten person by way of expiation? We do not find any elaboration of
~~this in any Hadith. Some `Ulama' have stated that it means meals of the
~~day and night. Some scholars have taken support of a Hadith and
~~suggested that it should be one Mudd (about half kilogram) per head
~~because this is the quantity which the Prophet (PBUH) prescribed as
~~expiation for sexual intercourse with one's wife during fasting. The
~~expiation prescribed by him was 15 Sa` dates which were to be divided
~~among sixty poor fellows. Since one Sa` consists of four Mudd, the
~~quantity of food, without curry, for ten persons would be six kilograms.
~~(Ibn Kathir). This means that it would be six kilograms of flour, or
~~rice, or dates etc. Thus, even if ten poor persons are served with an
~~average meal, it would be a substantial quantity. Allah Alone knows what
~~is correct.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: What is meant here is that if a person takes an oath while

# Commentary: The following points are clear from this Hadith:
# First, supplicating for safety and asking in the Name of Allah is

# Second, if a person begs in the Name of Allah, he should not be turned

~~which comes from the word Thartharah, meaning to speak repeatedly in an
~~artificial manner. Mutashaddiqun (loud-mouthed) is the plural of
~~Mutashaddiq, which means a person who speaks loudly to display his
~~eloquence. Mutafaihiqun is the plural of Mutafaihiq which is from the
~~word Fihq, meaning to fill. This Hadith is a reference to those people
~~who speak in a loud and lofty manner. All these characteristics of
~~speech are indicative of artificiality and affectation which are
~~condemned by Shari`ah, and people having these defects will be far away
~~from the Prophet (PBUH) and will face the Wrath of Allah. Islam likes
~~simple, polite and natural style of conversation. In fact, all moral
~~virtues will be a means of the nearness of the Prophet (PBUH) and the
~~Pleasure of Allah. May Allah enable us to adopt these virtues.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: The prohibition of going to bed before `Isha' prayer is

~~for Tahajjud prayer or Fajr prayer. Moreover, if a person goes to sleep
~~soon after `Isha' prayer, all his activities of the day will end at
~~`Isha', which is the most meritorious act. It should also be borne in
~~mind that when holding a conversation which is disliked or forbidden at
~~other times becomes even more so at this particular time (i.e., after
~~`Isha' prayer). Imam An-Nawawi's contention that things like academic
~~discussion, talking to a guest, discussing the lives of the pious etc.,
~~are not only permissible but desirable, is also subject to the condition
~~that such an activity does not involve the risk of losing the Fajr

# 1760. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: It is undesirable to fix Jumu`ah for voluntary fast. One
~~can, however, observe fasting if Friday occurs in his routine of fasts,
~~i.e., if one observes fast on alternate days and Jumu`ah occurs on the
~~day when he observes fast, or if one observes the fast of the Day of
~~`Arafah, or the Day of `Ashura', and Friday occurs on that day, or if
~~Friday occurs during the Ayyam Al-Beid, or Friday occurs when one is

# Commentary:
# 1. Through this Hadith we learn that in certain matters the Prophet
~~(PBUH) had some specific injunctions which were obligatory for him but
~~not for his Ummah. Such things were permissible for him but not for his
~~followers. All these things are called his special distinctions. It is
~~not permissible for Muslims to follow such practices. One of these
~~things is Saum Al-Wisal, which means to observe fast for several days at
~~a stretch without taking any food. Since Allah had granted him special
~~power and patience, he could observe fast continuously for days. As his
~~followers are not endowed with that energy and patience, they are not
~~permitted to do so.
# 2. "I am not like you'' does not mean that "I am not a man like you,''
~~because such an interpretation goes against a categorical statement of
~~the Qur'an to the effect that "I am a man like you''. What the statement
~~"I am not like you'' really means is "you do not possess that special
~~power which has been granted to me.''
# 3. "I am given to eat and to drink'' signifies that Allah (SWT)
~~provides him with the strength and energy which he can derive from food
~~and drink without necessarily having them.

# Commentary: We learn the following points from this Hadith:

~~level of prohibition when graves are ornamented and embellished.
# 2. Sitting on the graves is a disliked act, as has been made clear in

~~Then they said: "No one will be bold enough to do so except Usamah bin

~~one of the punishments prescribed by Allah?'' He then got up and
~~delivered an address in which he said, "Indeed what destroyed the people

# Commentary:
# 1. Hadd is the punishment fixed by Shari`ah and which no one has the
~~authority to increase or decrease. For instance, theft is punishable by
~~the cutting of the hand; the punishment of adultery is a hundred stripes
~~or Rajm (stoning to death); the punishment of drinking of intoxicants is

# 2. Nobody has the right to intercede or make any recommendation in

# 3. There is no distinction of male or female in the matter of these

~~punishment prescribed under Hadd - the punishment, the limits of which
~~have been defined in the Qur'an and Hadith.
# 4. No one is exempted from Hadd, no matter how great he is, because

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]
# Commentary: "Al-Hadir'' means one who lives in the city, while "Al-
~~Badi'' means a villager or a desert dweller. "He should not make a
~~deal'' here signifies that the urbanite should not go to the villager
~~and propose to him leave his goods with him for sale and he would send
~~him the sale proceeds of the goods piecemeal as they sell. In the
~~opinion of some `Ulama' this is prohibited if the merchandise is
~~valuable and the villager is not aware of its real worth and the
~~urbanite wants to exploit his ignorance. But, on the contrary, if the
~~proposal is for the welfare of the villager and the urbanite merely
~~wants the owner to receive its due price then the offer is admissible.
~~The first proposition is prohibited because that will cause a loss to
~~the villager; the second is permissible as it is a well-meaning offer.
# "A person in the city should not make a deal on behalf of a villager''
~~has been interpreted by `Abdullah bin `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with
~~them) to mean that he should not work as a broker for a villager because
~~in that case he will be interested to sell it on a higher price in order
~~to have a better commission in the deal, which will unnecessarily raise
~~its cost.
# On one side, the purchase of goods coming from outside has been
~~prohibited before its arrival on the market so that nobody can exploit
~~the ignorance of the outsiders, and on the other side, villagers are
~~enjoined to sell their goods themselves so that the commission of the
~~broker does not increase the price of the goods. If an urbanite sells
~~the merchandise of any villager on a fair price without charging any
~~commission then this is permissible, as is confirmed by Ahadith. If the
~~people living in cities charge each other commission on the purchase or

~~"Verily, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, `When you see those who

# [Muslim].
# Commentary: The purpose of this Hadith seems to be that one should
~~neither pay serious attention to one who praises nor reward him for it.
~~If one can throw grit in his face, that should also be done. One should
~~at least avoid such persons who are in the habit of praising people
~~unnecessarily.
# Imam An-Nawawi has stated that these Ahadith are in prohibition of
~~praise while there are many in favour of it. `Ulama' are of the opinion
~~that the two points of view can be reconciled. If the one who is praised
~~has perfect Faith and confidence and is endowed with the gift of
~~knowledge by Allah and has control over his self and thereby he is not
~~likely to go astray by praise, then praising him is neither unlawful nor
~~disgusting. But if he is vulnerable to praise then praising him in his
~~presence is abhorred. Ahadith in prohibition of praise support this
~~point of view. While one of the Ahadith, which are in favour of praise,
~~relates to the occasion when the Prophet (May Allah be pleased with him)
~~said to Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (May Allah be pleased with him): "I hope that
~~you will also be among them,'' that is "You will be one of hose who will
~~be called from every gate of Jannah.'' (See, Sahih Al-Bukhari, Kitab
~~Fada'il As-Sahabah). Another Hadith on the issue relates to the event
~~when the Prophet (PBUH) said to Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with
~~him): "You are not one of them.'' What it signified was that "You are
~~not one of those who keep their trousers below their ankles out of sheer
~~pride.'' (See, Sahih Al-Bukhari, Manaqib Abu Bakr). He said to `Umar
~~(May Allah be pleased with him): "When Satan sees you going on some way,

~~There was a difference of opinion whether they should proceed further or

~~set forth to fight the enemy, and therefore you should not go back;''
~~whereas some of them said: "As you have along with you many eminent
~~Companions of Messenger of Allah (PBUH), we would not advice you to set
~~forth to the place of the plague (and thus expose them deliberately to a

~~well. He said: "Now, you may go.'' He again said: "Call the old (wise
~~people) of the Quraish who had emigrated before the conquest of

~~them in this issue and not even two persons among them differed in the
~~opinions. They said: "We think that you should go back along with the
~~people and do not take them to this scourge. `Umar (May Allah be pleased

~~intend to go back, and I want you to do the same.'' Abu 'Ubaidah bin Al-
~~Jarrah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: "Are you going to run away
~~from the Divine Decree?'' Thereupon `Umar (May Allah be pleased with
~~him) said: "O Abu 'Ubaidah ! Had it been someone else to say this.''
~~('Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) did not like to differ with him).
~~He said: "Yes, we are running from the Divine Decree to the Divine
~~Decree. What do you think if you have camels and you happen to get down
~~a valley having two sides, one of them covered with foliage and the
~~other being barren, will you not act according to the Divine Decree if
~~you graze them in vegetative land? In case you graze them in the barren
~~land, even then you will be doing so according to the Divine Decree.
# There happened to come `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf who had been absent for
~~some of his needs. He said: I have knowledge about it. I heard the
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH) saying, "If you get wind of the outbreak of
~~plague in a land, you should not enter it; but if it spreads in the land
~~where you are, you should not depart from it.'' Thereupon `Umar bin

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: "Ajnad'' stands for five regions of Syria: Palestine,
~~Jordan, Damascus, Hims and Qansarin. (An-Nawawi).
# 'Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) praised Allah for the reason
~~that his own Ijtihad was in accordance with the Hadith of the Prophet
~~(PBUH). The opinion given by the groups of Ansar and Muhajirun before
~~this Ijtihad was also based on some principles of Shari`ah: those who
~~had advised not to return had evinced submission to the Will of Allah
~~and their absolute trust in Him, and the other group which had preferred
~~the way of precaution had suggested to avoid any such action which could
~~prove harmful.
# Although such precautionary measures could not save them from the
~~Divine Decree, they decided to take all possible precautions because
~~this is what is ordained by Allah. In fact, this was the basis of the
~~Ijtihad made by `Umar, the veracity of which was proved by the Hadith of
~~the Prophet (PBUH). This Hadith confirmed the point of view of Imam An-
~~Nawawi. Thus, this Hadith highlights the following four important
~~points:
# 1. The test of validity of any decision is its correspondence with
~~Shari`ah.
# 2. The desirability of mutual consultation.

~~of the cloth is made of cotton.

# 1797. Anas bin Sirin (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I was with
~~Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) in the company of some
~~Magians when Faludhaj (a sweet made of flour and honey) was brought in a
~~silver utensil, and Anas did not take it. The man was told to change the
~~utensil. So he changed the utensil and when he brought it to Anas, he
~~took it.
# [Al-Baihaqi].
# Commentary: From the above narrations, it is clear that the use of
~~utensils made of gold or silver is forbidden in Islam for eating,
~~drinking and for all other purposes. However, medical use of golden or
~~silver wire is not forbidden, e.g., the use of golden wire in securing
~~teeth, or fixing a tooth partly made of gold.
# Eating and drinking in utensils of precious metals (in which platinum
~~may also be included) is forbidden as it is a show of pride and
~~exhibition of richness. All such actions are against the basic teachings
~~of Islam. Precious metals should not be used for decoration either.
# 1. However, women may use precious metals as ornaments, since
~~according to some narrations there is exemption for the fair sex in this
~~matter. Still some scholars maintain that the chain of such narrations
~~is weak, so they do not allow their use in the ornaments of women as
~~well. Sheikh Al-Albani has discussed this matter in detail in Adab Az-
~~Zafaf and he does not agree with the opinion of these other scholars.
# 2. Silken dress is also forbidden for men and, similarly all types of
~~dresses resembling silk are forbidden for them, which are a speciality
~~of women. They are forbidden as creating likeness and resemblance to
~~women. The reason behind this is that the softness and delicacy found in
~~silk is against manliness.
# 3. The prohibition of these things reflects the temperament and
~~disposition of Islam. Islam encourages simplicity and piety in eating,
~~drinking, dress and living; and forbids luxury and ease that creates
~~resemblance and likeness with the disbelievers. Alas! Present-day
~~Muslims have adopted ease and luxury and made it the criterion of
~~nobility and are following in the footsteps of the disbelievers.
~~Everyone is busy day and night to attain the western standard of living
~~by hook or by crook. May Allah lead them on the Right Path.

# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary:
# 1. From the above narrations it becomes clear that one can not be
~~called an orphan when maturity is attained. The proof of maturity is
~~night discharge and not any particular age. The age of maturity may
~~differ in different countries according to the climate and individual
~~body development. So night discharge has been fixed as the condition and
~~criterion or sign of maturity. Night discharge means ejaculation of
~~semen during sleep.
# 2. During the pre-Islamic period, keeping quiet was also considered as
~~a sort of worship or devotion to God. Islam does not allow such ascetic
~~ceremonies and extravagance. So such actions are forbidden. Further it
~~has been stressed that instead of keeping quiet one should engage in
~~good actions, such as enjoining good, forbidding evil, entertaining a
~~guest, remembering Allah and glorifying Him. However, it is better to
~~keep quiet rather than telling lies, indulging in indecent talk or
~~backbiting.

~~read except Allah's Book and what is written in this scroll. He unrolled
~~the scroll which showed a list of what sort of camels to be given as
~~blood-money, and other legal matters relating to killing game in the
~~sanctuary of Makkah and the expiation thereof. In it was also written:
~~The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: `Al-Madinah is a sanctuary from `Air
~~to Thaur (mountains). He who innovates in this territory new ideas in
~~Islam, commits a sin therein, or shelters the innovators, will incur the
~~Curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and Allah will accept
~~from him neither repentance nor a ransom on the Day of Resurrection. The
~~asylum (pledge of protection) granted by any Muslim (even of the) lowest
~~status is to be honoured and respected by all other Muslims, and whoever
~~betrays a Muslim in this respect (by violating the pledge) will incur
~~the Curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people; and Allah will
~~accept from him neither repentance nor a ransom on the Day of
~~Resurrection. Whoever attributes his fatherhood to someone other than
~~his (real) father, and takes someone else as his master other than his
~~(real) master without his permission, will incur the Curse of Allah, the
~~angels and all the people, and Allah will accept from him neither
~~repentance nor a ransom on the Day of Resurrection.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: Air is a small mountain near Al-Madinah and Thaur is also
~~a small mountain behind the famous Mount Uhud. The area between these
~~two mountains is the forbidden area. It means that like the Haram of
~~Makkah, no game should be killed, no trees or plants of this area should
~~be cut and no disbeliever or polytheists should enter its boundary. The
~~words "a'dl" and "sarf" translated here as 'repentance' and 'ransom'
~~respectively also mean obligatory and voluntary (Nafl) acts of worship.
# It has been established here that any act of disobedience or sin
~~committed in Al-Madinah becomes a greater sin than if it is committed
~~anywhere else. This Hadith also establishes that the claim that `Ali
~~(May Allah be pleased with him) was given some specific knowledge of
~~Khilafah (caliphate), which was not given to anybody else is also false.
~~The Hadith also makes it clear that attributing one's fatherhood to
~~someone other than his real father is a grave sin.

~~1808. An-Nawwas bin Sam`an (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: One
~~morning the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) made a mention of Dajjal, and he
~~described him to be insignificant and at the same time described him so
~~significant that we thought he was on the date-palm trees (i.e.,
~~nearby). When we went to him (the Prophet (PBUH)) in the evening, he
~~perceived the sign of fear on our faces. He said, "What is the matter
~~with you?'' We said: "O Messenger of Allah, you talked about Dajjal this
~~morning raising your voice and lowering it until we thought he was
~~hiding in the palm-trees grove: He said: "Something other than Dajjal
~~make worry about you. If he appears while I am with you, I will defend
~~you against him. But if he appears after I die, then everyone of you is
~~his own defender. Allah is the One Who remains after me to guide every
~~Muslim. Dajjal will be a young man with very curly hair with one eye
~~protruding (with which he cannot see). I compare (his appearance) to
~~that of Al-`Uzza bin Qatan. He who amongst you survives to see him,
~~should recite over him the opening Ayat of Surat Al-Kahf (i.e., Surat

~~one day like a month, one day like a week and the rest of the days will
~~be like your days.'' We said: "O Messenger of Allah! Will one day's
~~Salat (prayer) suffice for the Salat of that day which will be equal to
~~one year?'' Thereupon he said, "No, but you must make an estimate of
~~time and then offer Salat.'' We said: "O Messenger of Allah! How quickly
~~will he walk upon the earth?'' Thereupon he said, "Like cloud driven by
~~the wind (i.e., very quickly). He will come to the people and call them
~~to his obedience and they will affirm their faith in him and respond to
~~him. He will then give command to the sky and it will send its rain upon
~~the earth and he will then send his command to the earth and it will
~~grow vegetation. Then in the evening their pasturing animals will come
~~to them with their humps very high and their udders full of milk and
~~their flanks stretched. He will then come to another people and invite
~~them, but they will reject him and he will leave them, in barren lands
~~and without any goods and chattels! He would then walk through the waste

~~come out and follow him like swarms of bees. He will then call a person
~~brimming with youth and strike him with the sword and cut him into two
~~pieces and make these pieces lie at a distance, which is generally
~~between the archer and his target. He will then call that young man and
~~he will come forward, laughing, with his face gleaming out of joy; and
~~it will be at this very time that Allah will send `Isa (Jesus), son of
~~Maryam (Mary) who will descend at the white minaret in the eastern side
~~of Damascus, wearing two garments lightly dyed and placing his hands on
~~the wings of two angels. When he will lower his head, there would fall
~~drops of water from his head, and when he will raise it up, drops like
~~pearls would scatter from it. Every disbeliever who will find his (i.e.,
~~`Isa's) smell will die and his smell will reach as far as he will be
~~able to see. He will then search for Dajjal until he will catch hold of
~~him at the gate of Ludd (village near Jerusalem), and will kill him.
~~Then the people, whom Allah will have protected, will come to `Isa son
~~of Maryam, and he will wipe their faces and will inform them of their
~~ranks in Jannah, and it will be under such conditions that Allah will
~~reveal to `Isa these words: `I have brought forth from amongst my slaves
~~such people against whom none will be able to fight, so take these
~~people safely to the mountain.' And then Allah will send Ya'juj and
~~Ma'juj (Gog and Magog people) and they will sworn down from every slope.
~~The first of them will pass the Lake Tabariyah (near the Dead Sea in
~~Palestine) and drink all its water. And when the last of them will pass,
~~he will say: `There was once water there.' Prophet `Isa (PBUH) and his
~~companions will then be so much hard-pressed that the head of an ox will
~~be dearer to them than one hundred dinar, and `Isa along with his
~~companions, will make supplication to Allah, Who will send insects which
~~will attack their (Ya'juj and Ma'juj people) neck until they all will
~~perish like a single person. Prophet, `¦sa and his companions will then
~~come down and they will not find in the earth as much space as a single
~~span which would not be filled with their corpses and their stench.
~~Prophet `Isa and his companions will then again beseech Allah, Who will
~~send birds whose necks will be like those of Bactrian camels, and they
~~will carry them and throw them where Allah will desire. Then Allah will
~~send down rain which will spare no house in the city or in the
~~countryside. It would wash away the earth until it appears like a
~~mirror. Then the earth will be told to bring forth its fruit and restore
~~its blessings; and as a result of this, there will grow such a big
~~pomegranate that a group of people will eat from it and seek shelter
~~under its skin. Milk will be so blessed that the milk of one she-camel
~~will suffice for a large company and the cow will give so much milk,
~~that it will suffice for a whole tribe. The sheep will give so much milk
~~that the whole family will be able to drink out of that, and at that
~~time Allah will send a pleasant wind which will soothe people even under
~~their armpits, and will take the life of every Muslim and true believer,
~~and only the wicked will survive. They will commit adultery in public
~~like asses and the Resurrection Day will be held.''

~~know whether this will be forty days or forty months or forty years.
~~Allah will then send (Prophet) `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). `Isa

~~years (i.e., after the demise of `Isa) in the state that there will be
~~no rancour between two persons. Then Allah will send a cool breeze from

~~the smallest particle of good or Faith in him but he will die, so much
~~so that even if someone amongst you will enter the innermost part of a

~~die. Only the wicked people will survive and they will be as fast as
~~birds (i.e., to commit evil) and as ferocious towards one another as
~~wild beasts. They will never appreciate the good, nor condemn evil. Then
~~Shaitan (Satan) will come to them in the garb of a man and will say:
~~`Will you not obey me?' They will say: `What do you order us to do?' He
~~will command them to worship idols. They will have abundance of
~~sustenance and will lead comfortable lives. Then the Trumpet will be

~~busy repairing the basin for his camels. He will become unconscious.
~~Allah will send, or will cause to send, rain which will be like dew and
~~there will grow out of it (like wild growth) the bodies of the people.
~~Then the second Trumpet will be blown and they will stand up and begin
~~to look around. Then it will be said: `O people! Go to your Rubb.' Then
~~there will be a command: `Make them stand there.' After it they will be
~~called to account. Then it will be said: `Separate from them the share

~~will be the Day when the Shin will be uncovered.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: The question arises as to what is the meaning of the
~~phrase - the Shin will be uncovered - at this place? Some people say
~~that it refers to the calamities and troubles of the Day of Judgement.
~~But according to a reliable narration, it refers to an act of Allah of
~~uncovering His Shin in a way which befits His Majesty. As believers, we
~~must confirm Allah's all Qualities which He has stated in the Qur'an or
~~mentioned through His Messenger (PBUH) without changing them or ignoring
~~them completely or twisting their meanings or giving resemblance to any
~~of the created things. What is meant by the uncovering of the Shin of
~~Allah is something we can neither understand nor describe. We can only
~~believe in it without understanding the real explanation of it, in the
~~same way we believe in the Eye or Ear of Allah. We should believe in all
~~these things as mentioned in the Qur'an and Hadith without trying to go
~~into the explanation. This is the view of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah to

~~the armed watchmen of Dajjal will meet him and they will say to him:
~~`Where do you intend to go?' He will say: `I intend to go to this one

~~say: `O people! This is Dajjal about whom the Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
~~has informed us.' Dajjal will have him laid on his stomach and have his
~~head. He will be struck on his back and on his stomach. Dajjal will ask
~~him: `Don't you believe in me?' He will say: `You are the false
~~Messiah.' He will then give his order to have him sawn with a saw into
~~two from the parting of his hair up to his legs. After that Dajjal will
~~walk between the two halves and will say to him: `Stand up', and he will
~~stand on his feet. He will then say to him: `Don't you believe in me?'
~~The person will say: `It has added to my insight that you are Dajjal'.
~~He will add: `O people! He will not be able to behave with anyone

~~The space between his neck and collarbone will turn into copper and he
~~will find no way to kill him. So he will catch hold of him by his hand

~~وسلم قال : [ اشترى رجل من رجل عقارا فوجد الذي اشترى العقار في عقاره جرة
~~فيها ذهب فقال له الذي اشترى العقار خذ ذهبك إنما اشتريت منك الأرض ولم
~~أشتر الذهب وقال الذي له الأرض إنما بعتك الأرض وما فيها فتحاكما إلى رجل
~~فقال الذي تحاكما إليه : ألكما ولد ؟ قال أحدهما : لي غلام وقال الآخر : لي

# 1826. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The
~~Prophet (PBUH) said, "A man bought a piece of land from another man, and
~~the buyer found a jar filled with gold in the land. The buyer said to
~~the seller: `Take your gold, as I bought only the land from you and not
~~the gold.' The owner of the land said: `I sold you the land with
~~everything in it.' So both of them took their case before a third man
~~who asked: `Have you any children?' One of them said: `I have a boy.'
~~The other said, `I have a girl.' The man said: `Marry the girl to the
~~boy and spend the money on them; and whatever remains give it in
~~charity.'''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: This is the story of some people from the past, in which
~~exemplary honesty, piety and the will to abstain from the doubtful
~~property has been described. But as far as the law of Shari`ah is
~~concerned, it appears that in the transaction of land, any buried
~~treasure will not be included in the sale. It will be considered quite
~~separately and apart from the sale of the land. If the previous owner
~~says that the treasure belongs to him and he forgot to take it out, then
~~it will be considered as his property and not the property of the buyer
~~of the land. But if he shows ignorance about it, then it will be
~~considered under the title of "Rikaz". In such a case, one-fifth of it
~~goes to the public treasury and the rest to the owner of the land. Rikaz
~~refers to any buried treasure which is discovered in any land.

~~younger woman said: `Do not do so; may Allah bless you! He is her

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: Prophet Sulaiman (Solomon) (PBUH) went to the depth of the

~~device or a trick as a method of discovering the truth. He used this
~~trick to discover the truth and not to evade it. Such a trick is not

~~death. So a believer starts longing to meet Allah as a result of the
~~good news he receives at that time, and the disbeliever begins to wish
~~that he may not die and, therefore, avoid Allah's punishment as a result
~~of the bad news he receives at that time.

# 1849. Safiyyah bint Huyai (May Allah be pleased with him), the Mother
~~of the Believers, said: I came to visit the Prophet (PBUH) while he was
~~in the state of I`tikaf [(seclusion) in the mosque during the last ten
~~days of Ramadan]. After having talked to him, I got up to return. The
~~Prophet (PBUH) also got up with me and accompanied me a part of the way.
~~At that moment two Ansari man passed by. When they saw him they
~~quickened their pace. The Prophet (PBUH) said to them, "Do not hurry.
~~She is Safiyyah, daughter of Huyai, my wife.'' They said: "Subhan Allah
~~(Allah is free from imperfection)! O Messenger of Allah! (You are far
~~away from any suspicion).'' The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Satan
~~circulates in a person like blood (in the blood streams). I apprehended
~~lest Satan should drop some evil thoughts in your minds.''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].
# Commentary: Even just a passing thought of some thing undesirable
~~about the Prophet (PBUH) is dangerous for belief. In order to put an end
~~to this evil suspicion, he stopped the two Companions and explained to
~~them the situation. This was done lest the devil may create some doubt
~~in the mind of the two Companions. The conclusion is that, if at any
~~place there is some far fetched chance of creation of bad opinion about
~~somebody, then it is necessary to give an explanation lest some doubt
~~may arise in some body's mind. This is particularly essential for
~~`Ulama', who should remain aloof from such occasions and places, lest

~~of (the battle of) Hunain. Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith and I did not leave
~~the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) throughout the battle. The Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) was riding on his white mule. When the Muslims had an
~~encounter with the pagans, Muslims took to their heels. The Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) began to urge his mule towards the disbelievers, holding
~~the bridle of his mule. I was trying to restrain it from going very
~~fast, and Abu Sufyan was holding the stirrup of the mule of the
~~Messenger of Allah (PBUH). The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "O Abbas!
~~Call out the People of As-Samurah [i.e., those people who had made the
~~covenant under the tree (i.e., Bai`ah Ridwan)].'' `Abbas called out at
~~the top of his voice: "Where are the People of As-Samurah.'' `Abbas
~~said: As soon as they heard my voice, they rushed towards the Prophet
~~(PBUH) like a cow turning towards her calf. They were shouting: "Here we
~~are.'' Soon they began to fight the infidels. Then there was a call for
~~Ansar. Those who called out to them shouted: "O you the people of Ansar!
~~O you the people of Ansar!'' They ended their call at Banu Al-Harith bin
~~Al-Khazraj. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) who was riding on his mule
~~looked at their fight with his neck stretched forward and he said, "This
~~is the time when the fight is raging hot.'' Then the Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) took pebbles and threw them in the face of the disbelievers. He
~~said, "By the Rubb of Muhammad, the disbelievers will be defeated.'' I
~~continued to watch until I found that their force was subdued and they
~~began to retreat.
# [Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. Here is the factual proof of the bravery and greatness of the
~~Prophet (PBUH). We see that initially when the Companions were perturbed
~~and they scattered here and there, he alone continued his march towards
~~the enemy. He did not feel even the slightest fear or worry. In the end
~~his steadfastness compelled others to return and fight the enemy.
# 2. In fact, they had not receded far. They had got confused for a
~~while. The reason for this confusion was the continuous and sudden
~~volley of arrows which was quite unexpected for them. However, at the
~~call of Al-`Abbas (May Allah be pleased with him) they at once turned
~~back to fight. Had they gone far off, their sudden re-organisation and
~~collecting again would not have been possible.
# 3. Here is the proof of a miracle of the Prophet (PBUH) as well; the
~~throwing of few pebbles from his side caused the defeat of the enemy.
# 4. Here, the Muslims were taught a lesson that the real power in the
~~battlefield is the strength of Belief and the Help of Allah. The
~~position of the armaments and other things is secondary. So, one should
~~not depend on these means and resources alone. Otherwise, one will
~~certainly face defeat in spite of large number of soldiers and better
~~means, as happened initially in the battle of Hunain. The trust should
~~be on Allah and His Special Help. His Will alone is the deciding factor
~~in every matter.

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

# Commentary: Sheikh Al-Albani says that this fasting refers to fasting

# Sheikh Al-Albani has particularized the narration by `Aishah (May
~~Allah be pleased with her) with the help of the narration of Ibn `Abbas
~~(May Allah be pleased with them), in which the fasting of vow is
~~specifically mentioned. The reason is that in the bodily worship, acting
~~on the behalf of others is not permitted. As one cannot act or perform
~~any bodily worship on behalf of others, similarly it is not allowed to
~~do so after somebody's death. However, if in any particular case, there
~~is a ruling in the Qur'an or Sunnah then in that particular matter
~~deputizing would be allowed. In such case the permission should be
~~limited to that particular matter only. For example it is specifically
~~mentioned in the Hadith that the Wali, i.e., the guardian or inheritor
~~of the dead person can observe the fasting of vow taken by the deceased
~~person to Allah. However, no offering of other bodily worship, such as
~~Salat, will be permitted on behalf of the deceased person.

~~(`Abdullah bin Az-Zubair) say so?'' The people said: "Yes.'' `Aishah
~~(May Allah be pleased with her) said: "I vow it before Allah that I will

~~`Abdullah bin Az-Zubair sought intercession with her, but she said: "By
~~Allah I will not accept the intercession of anyone for him, and I will
~~not commit a sin of breaking my vow.'' When this state of affairs was
~~prolonged, Ibn Az-Zubair felt it hard on him. He said to Al-Miswar bin

~~the Name of Allah that you should take me to `Aishah because it is
~~unlawful for her to vow to sever relations with me.'' So Al-Miswar and

~~forbade to cut off relationship because it is unlawful for any Muslim
~~not to talk to his (Muslim) brother (or sister, for that matter) for
~~more than three (days).'' So when they persisted in urging and reminding
~~her of the superiority of having good relation with kith and kin, she
~~began to weep, saying: "I have made a vow which is a matter of very
~~serious nature.'' They persisted in their appeal till she spoke with
~~`Abdullah bin Az-Zubair, and she freed forty slaves as an expiation for
~~breaking her vow. Later on, whenever she remembered her vow, she would
~~weep so much that her veil would become wet with tears.
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair (May Allah be pleased with him)
~~was the real nephew of `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her). She had
~~made a vow that she would not talk to her nephew. She thought that such
~~an oath was permissible as her nephew (the then governor of Makkah) had
~~shown his intention to put a ban on the spending of `Aishah (May Allah

~~realized his mistake and went to his aunt to seek forgiveness along with
~~two persons as recommenders. After this, it was proper for her to break
~~her oath and resume her relations with him. The expiation for breaking a
~~vow is the same as that of breaking an oath, i.e., to feed ten indigent
~~people on a scale of the average for the food of one's family, or cloth
~~them, or give a slave his freedom. If one cannot afford any of these
~~things, then he should fast for three days. (See Qur'an, 5:89) But

~~الله عليه وسلم : [ من قتل وزغة في أول ضربة فله كذا وكذا حسنة ومن قتلها
~~في الضربة الثانية فله كذا وكذا حسنة دون الأولي وإن قتلها في الضربة
~~الثالثة فله كذا وكذا حسنة ]
# وفي رواية : [ من قتل وزغا في أول ضربة كتب له مائة حسنة وفي الثانية دون

# قال أهل اللغة : الوزغ : العظام من سام أبرص
# 1864. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) said, "He who kills a chameleon at the first blow, such
~~and such number of good deeds will be awarded to him; whoever kills it
~~at the second blow, such and such number of merits will be recorded for
~~him. And if he kills it at the third blow, he will get such and such
~~merits.''
# Another narration is: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "If anyone
~~kills a chameleon with the first blow, a hundred good deeds will be
~~recorded for him; less than that will be recorded for him if he kills it
~~at the second blow, and still less rewards will be recorded for him if
~~he kills it at the third blow.''
# [Muslim].
# Commentary: Here, it is mentioned that the killing of a chameleon in
~~one stroke is very commendable. Similar is the case of killing of other
~~harmful insects and reptiles such as scorpions, and snakes. This shows
~~that even a slight help in good or bad actions will be counted and
~~rewarded or punished as the case may be. The matter of quantity is not
~~so important, but the real thing is the intention and real motive. It
~~could be that the chameleon did, in fact, blew fire on Ibrahim; or it
~~could be that it simply refers to the chameleon's harmful nature to
~~human beings. Allah knows better.

~~`Indeed! I will give in charity.' So he took his Sadaqah out and placed
~~it in a thief's hand. In the morning the people were talking (about this
~~incident) and saying: `Sadaqah was given to a thief last night.' The man
~~said: `O Allah! Praise be to You. I have given Sadaqah to a thief.

~~placed it in a prostitute's hand. In the morning the people were talking
~~(about this incident) and saying: `Sadaqah was given to a prostitute
~~last night.' On hearing this, the man said: `Praise be to You, O Allah!
~~I gave Sadaqah to a prostitute. Indeed, I will give in charity!' So he
~~took his Sadaqah out and placed it in a rich man's hand. In the morning
~~the people were talking (about this incident) and saying: `Sadaqah was
~~given to a rich man last night.' The man said: `O Allah! Praise be to
~~You (for helping me) give charity to a thief, a prostitute and a rich
~~man.' Then he had a dream in which he was told that his Sadaqah to the
~~thief might result in his refraining from his theft, his Sadaqah to the
~~prostitute might help her abstain from her immorality, and his Sadaqah
~~to the rich man might help him pay heed and spend from what Allah had
~~bestowed upon him.''
# [Al-Bukhari].
# Commentary: If the intention of the person giving away something in
~~charity is good, it will be accepted and rewarded by Allah even though
~~it may be given to an undeserving person. However, it is better to give
~~charity to deserving, pious people.

~~1866. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: We
~~accompanied the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) to a banquet. The meat of the
~~forearm was presented to him as he was very fond of it. The Messenger of
~~Allah (PBUH) ate a morsel of it and said, "I will be the master of all
~~the people on the Day of Resurrection. Do you know why? Allah will
~~gather all human beings, past and present generations on the same ground
~~so that the announcer may be able to make them all hear his voice and
~~the onlookers may be able to see all of them. The sun will come very
~~close to the people, they will suffer such distress and trouble as they
~~will not be able to bear. Then the people will say: `Do you see our
~~(miserable) condition? You should look for someone who can intercede for
~~you with your Rubb.' Some people will say to the others: `Go to your
~~father, Adam.' So they will go to Adam and say to him: `You are the
~~father of mankind; Allah created you with His Own Hand, and breathed
~~into you of His spirit, ordered the angels to prostrate before you and
~~He made you dwell in Jannah. So (please) intercede for us with your
~~Rubb. Do you not see our (miserable) condition?' Adam will say: `Today
~~my Rubb has become so angry as He has never been before, nor will He
~~ever become angry after this. He forbade me to approach the tree, but I
~~disobeyed Him. I am worried about myself. Go to someone else. Go to
~~(Prophet) Nuh (Noah).' They will come to Nuh and will say to him: `O
~~Nuh! You are the first of Messenger of Allah to the people on the earth,
~~and Allah has named you a grateful slave. Please intercede for us with
~~your Rubb. Do you not see our (miserable) condition?' He will say:
~~`Today my Rubb his become so angry as He has never been before, nor will
~~He become angry hereafter. I was granted the right to make one
~~definitely accepted invocation. I availed of this opportunity and made
~~it against my nation. I am worried about myself. Go to someone else. Go
~~to (Prophet) Ibrahim (Abraham).' They will go to Ibrahim and say to him:
~~`O Ibrahim, you are Messenger of Allah and His Khalil (the intimate
~~friend of Allah) from among the people of the earth; so please intercede
~~for us with your Rubb. Don't you see our (miserable) condition?' He will
~~say to them: `Today my Rubb has become so angry as He has never been
~~before; nor will he ever be so hereafter. I had told three lies. I am
~~worried about myself. Go to someone else. Go to (Prophet) Musa (Moses).'
~~The people will then go to Musa and say to him: `O Musa! You are
~~Messenger of Allah and Allah gave you superiority above the others with
~~His Message and with His direct Talk to you, so intercede for us with
~~your Rubb. Do you not see our (miserable) condition?' Musa will say:
~~`Today my Rubb has become so angry as he has never been before, nor will
~~He ever be hereafter. I killed a man whom I had not been ordered to
~~kill. I am worried about myself. Go to someone else. Go to (Prophet)
~~`Isa (Jesus).' So they will go to `¦sa and say to him: `O `Isa! You are
~~Messenger of Allah and His Word (i.e., "Be''-and he was) which he
~~bestowed on Maryam (Mary) and a spirit created by Him; and you talked to
~~the people while you were in the cradle. Please intercede for us with
~~your Rubb. Do you not see our (miserable) condition?' `¦sa will say:
~~`Today my Rubb has become so angry as He has never been before, nor will
~~He ever be like this hereafter.' `Isa will not mention any sin, but will
~~say: `I am worried about myself. Go to someone else. Go to Muhammad
~~(PBUH).'''
# Another narration is: The Messenger of Allah said, "They will come to
~~me and say: `O Muhammad! You are the Messenger of Allah and the Last of
~~Prophets, and Allah has forgiven your past and future sins. Please
~~intercede for us with your Rubb. Do you not see our (miserable)
~~condition?''' The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) added, "Then I will proceed
~~under Allah's Throne and fall down in prostration before my Rubb. Then,
~~He will bestow upon me knowledge of such praises and glorification to
~~Him as He has never bestowed upon anybody else before me. Then I will be
~~addressed: `O Muhammad! Raise your head. Ask, and your request will be
~~granted. Intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.' So I will
~~raise my head and say: `My followers, O my Rubb! My followers, O my
~~Rubb! My followers, O my Rubb!' It will be said: `O Muhammad! Admit into
~~Jannah such people as are not subjected to reckoning through the right
~~gate of Jannah.' The rest of them will be admitted along with the rest
~~of mankind through the various gates of Jannah.'' The Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) further said, "By Him in Whose Hand my soul is! The distance
~~between every two sides of the gates of Jannah is like the distance
~~between Makkah and Hajar, or that between Makkah and Busra (Syria).''
# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]
# Commentary:
# 1. Hajar is a town in Bahrain and Busra is a city in Harran which is
~~situated in the south of Damascus. This means that each of the gates of
~~the Jannah will be so broad that the distance between its two sides
~~would be thousands of miles.
# 2. In this narration, the greatness and superiority of the Prophet
~~(PBUH) has been described. On the Day of Resurrection when the great
~~Prophets would not dare to speak or request leniency for mankind, only
~~Muhammad (PBUH) would intercede for the people and request for mercy by
~~the Permission of Allah. The first request which he will make would be
~~that accountability may be started, so that the people may be freed as
~~soon as possible from the hardships and troubles of the Day of
~~Resurrection. This part of the Hadith has not been mentioned in this
~~narration; but it has been described in other narrations. This would be
~~a general request.
# The second intercession will be for his own Ummah. This will take
~~place in several stages. Here, the first stage has been mentioned. In
~~this stage Allah will send those people to Jannah whose accountability
~~would not be necessary.
# Next stage would be when the sinners among the believers would have
~~completed their period of punishment in Hell and then Allah will send
~~them to Jannah upon the intercession of the Prophet (PBUH).
# Other Prophets will seek to be excused from recommending or advocating
~~because of some of their slips. The real reason for this attitude of
~~theirs is that they are on such high pedestal of greatness and piety
~~that even a slight slip of theirs which does come under the boundary of
~~unworthiness would be felt by them to be very significant. This is just
~~like the proverb which says that even the nice action of the pious ones
~~are considered to be the blemishes and defects for the friends of Allah.
~~Similar is the case with the Prophets, they excused themselves from
~~advocating their case before Allah because of their insignificant slips.
# 3. Special reference may be made of the three statements of Prophet
~~Ibrahim which were apparently not according to the outward facts, so
~~they have been described as `not factual'. In reality they were not mis-
~~statements, but only a way of convincing the people about the basic
~~universal truth, and making them realize their misunderstanding. These
~~three are mentioned in a long Hadith narrated on the authority of Abu
~~Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him): Ibrahim (PBUH) did not tell a
~~lie except on three occasions. Twice for the sake of Allah when he said,
~~"I am sick'' (37:89) and he said, "(I have not done this) but the big
~~idol had done it.'' (21:63) (The third was) that while Ibrahim and Sarah
~~(his wife) were going (on a journey) they passed by (the territory of) a
~~tyrant from among the tyrants. Someone said to the tyrant, "This man
~~(i.e., Ibrahim) is accompanied by a very charming lady.'' So, he sent
~~for Ibrahim and asked him about Sarah, saying, "Who is this lady?''
~~Ibrahim said, "She is my sister.'' Ibrahim went to Sarah and said, "O
~~Sarah! There are no believers on the surface of the earth except you and
~~I. This man asked me about you and I told him that you are my sister. So
~~do not contradict my statement...'' (Al-Bukhari, vol. 4, Hadith No. 578)
# The idolaters invited Ibrahim to join them in their celebrations
~~outside the city, but he refused, claiming that he was sick. When he was
~~left alone, he came to their idols and broke them. When the idolaters
~~questioned him, he claimed that he had not destroyed their idols but the
~~chief idol had, which Ibrahim left undisturbed and on whose shoulder he
~~had put an axe to lay the accusation on it. To conclude, Ibrahim, like
~~all other Prophets is free from sins, but the three acts which he made
~~in good faith were to guide his people to the truth and to save his wife
~~from the evil of the then tyrant.

~~1867. Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Ibrahim
~~(PBUH) brought his wife and her son Isma`il (PBUH), while she was
~~suckling him, to a place near the Ka`bah under a tree on the spot of
~~Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. In those days, there was no
~~human being in Makkah, nor was there any water. So he made them sit over
~~there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a
~~small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Isma`il's
~~mother followed him saying: "O Ibrahim! Where are you going, leaving us
~~in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor
~~is there anything (to enjoy)?'' She repeated that to him many times, but
~~he did not look back at her. Then she asked him: "Has Allah commanded
~~you to do so?'' He said: "Yes.'' She said: "Then He will not neglect
~~us.'' She returned while Ibrahim proceeded onwards. Having reached the
~~Thaniya, where they could not see him, he faced Ka`bah, raised his both
~~hands and supplicated: "O our Rubb! I have made some of my offspring to
~~dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka`bah at
~~Makkah) in order, O our Rubb, that they may perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-
~~Salat). So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O
~~Allah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks.'' (14:37).
# Isma`il's mother went on suckling Isma`il and drinking from the water
~~which she had. When the water in the water-skin had all been used up,
~~she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started
~~looking at Isma`il, tossing in agony. She left him, for she could not
~~endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of As-Safa was the
~~nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started
~~looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she
~~could not see anybody. Then she descended from As-Safa, and when she
~~reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a
~~person in distress and trouble till she crossed the valley and reached
~~Al-Marwah mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see
~~somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running
~~between As-Safa and Al-Marwah) seven times.'' Ibn `Abbas further
~~related: The Prophet (PBUH) said, "This is the source of the tradition
~~of the Sa`y - i.e., the going of people between the two mountains. When
~~she reached Al-Marwah (for the last time), she heard a voice and she
~~exclaimed: `Shshs!' (Silencing herself) and listened attentively. She
~~heard the voice again and said: `O (whoever you may be) You have made me
~~hear your voice; have you any succour for me?' And behold! She saw an
~~angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or with
~~his wing), till water flowed out from that place. She started to make
~~something like of a basin around it, using her hands in this way and
~~began to fill her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water
~~was flowing out until she had scooped some of it.'' The Prophet (PBUH)
~~further said, "May Allah bestow mercy on Isma'il's mother! Had she let
~~the Zamzam flow without trying to control it (or had she not scooped in
~~that water) while filling her water-skin, Zamzam would have been a
~~stream flowing on the surface of the earth.'' The Prophet (PBUH) further
~~added, "Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to
~~her: `Do not be afraid of being neglected, for this is the site on which
~~the House of Allah will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah
~~will never let neglected His people.' The House of Allah (the Ka`bah) at
~~that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents
~~came, they flowed to its right and left. She continued living in that
~~way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum passed by her and her
~~child. As they were coming from through the way of Kada`, in the lower
~~part of Makkah where they saw a bird that had a habit of flying around
~~water and not leaving it. They said: `This bird must be flying over
~~water, though we know that there is no water in this valley.' They sent
~~one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned
~~to inform them of the water. So, they all came towards the water.'' The
~~Prophet (PBUH) added, "Isma`il's mother was sitting near the water. They
~~asked her: `Do you allow us to stay with you?' She replied: `Yes, but
~~you will have no right to possess the water.' They agreed to that.'' The
~~Prophet (PBUH) further said, "Isma`il's mother was pleased with the
~~whole situation as she used to love the company of the people. So, they
~~settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and
~~settled with them. The child (i.e., Isma`il) grew up and learnt Arabic
~~from them (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew
~~up, and when he reached the age of puberty, they gave him one of their
~~daughters in marriage. After Isma`il's mother had died, Ibrahim came
~~after Isma`il's marriage in order to see his family that he had left
~~before, but he did not find Isma`il there. When he asked Isma`il's wife
~~about him, she replied: `He has gone in search of our livelihood.' Then
~~he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she
~~replied complaining to him: `We are living in hardship, misery and
~~destitution.' He said: `When your husband returns, convey my salutations
~~to him and tell him to change the threshold of the door of his house.'
~~When Isma`il came, he seemed to have perceived something unusual. He
~~asked his wife: `Did anyone visit you?' She replied: `Yes, an old man of
~~such and such description came and asked me about you and I informed
~~him, and he asked about our state of living, and, I told him that we
~~were living in hardship and poverty.' Thereupon Isma`il said: `Did he
~~advise you anything?' She replied: `Yes, he told me to convey his
~~salutations to you and to change the threshold of your door.' Isma`il
~~said: `That was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back
~~to your family.' So Isma`il divorced her and married another woman from
~~amongst them (Jurhum). Then Ibrahim stayed away from them for a period
~~as long as Allah wished, and called on them again but did not find
~~Isma`il. So he came to Isma`il's wife and asked her about him. She said:
~~`He has gone in search of our livelihood.' Ibrahim asked her about their
~~sustenance and living: `How are you getting on?' She replied: `We are
~~prosperous and well off.' Then she praised Allah, the Exalted. Ibrahim
~~asked: `What kind of food do you eat?' She said: `Meat.' He said: `What
~~do you drink?' She said: `Water.' He said, `O Allah! Bless their meat
~~and water!''' The Prophet (PBUH) added, "At that time they did not have
~~grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless
~~it.'' The Prophet (PBUH) further said, "If somebody has only these two
~~things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly
~~affected because these things do not suit him unless he lives in
~~Makkah.'' The Prophet (PBUH) added, "Then Ibrahim said to Isma`il's
~~wife, `When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that
~~he should keep firm the threshold of his door.' When Isma`il came back,
~~he asked his wife: `Did anyone call on you?' She replied: `Yes, a good
~~looking old man came to me.' She praised him and added: `He asked about
~~you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told
~~him that we were in good condition.' Isma`il asked her: `Did he give you
~~a piece of advice?' She said: `Yes, he told me to convey his regards to
~~you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your door.'
~~On that Isma`il said: `He was my father and you are the threshold of the
~~door. He has ordered me to keep you with me.' Then Ibrahim stayed away
~~from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them
~~afterwards. He saw Isma`il under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his
~~arrows. When he saw Ibrahim, he rose up to welcome him, and they greeted
~~each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father.
~~Ibrahim said: `O Isma`il! Allah has given me an order.' Isma`il said:
~~`Do what your Rubb has commanded you to do.' Ibrahim asked: `Will you
~~help me?' Isma`il said: `I will help you.' Ibrahim said: `Allah has
~~ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the
~~land surrounding it.''' The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) added, "Then they
~~raised the foundations of the House (i.e., Ka`bah). Isma`il brought the
~~stones and Ibrahim was building (the house). When the walls became high,
~~Isma`il brought stone and placed it for Ibrahim who stood over it and
~~carried on building the House, while Isma`il was handing over the stones
~~to him, both of them prayed: `O our Rubb! Accept this service from us!
~~Verily, You are the All-Hearer and the All-Knower.'''

# There are some more narrations about this incident, some adding
~~details and some with minor variations in the wordings.
# Commentary:
# 1. In this narration, there is the historical background of walking
~~briskly between the hills of As-Safa and Al-Marwah. This ritual of Hajj
~~and `Umrah has been fixed as a remembrance of the incident about what
~~Hajirah (May Allah be pleased with her) had to face and what she did in
~~the difficult circumstances. In fact, she was so pious and obedient that
~~she agreed to live in such wilderness where there was no sign of any
~~human being far and wide. Secondly, there was no water to drink or food
~~for subsistence.
# For this act of piety, she was rewarded with two things; firstly, she
~~was bestowed with an eternally flowing spring which proved for her at
~~that moment a source of life, and people still benefit from it today.
~~Secondly, her brisk movement and running between the two hills was made
~~an important and compulsory ritual to be performed during Hajj and
~~`Umrah. This ritual is to continue for all times till the Day of
~~Resurrection.
# 2. Ka`bah was built by Prophet Ibrahim and Prophet Isma`il.
# 3. Thanking Allah under all circumstances is an act of praise and
~~piety while the reverse of this attitude is disliked and considered
~~reprehensible.
# 4. If a father asks his son to do something, then the child should
~~respond to the father's request as long as he does not order him to
~~disobey Allah.

~~the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) saying, "Truffle (edible fungus) is a
~~species of Al-Manna and their water cures eye diseases.'' [Al-Bukhari

~~bestowed upon Banu Israel. As-Salwa was a kind of bird resembling the
~~quail. It was slaughtered and then eaten. Al-Manna was a sweet substance
~~which appeared on the trees or stones. It was sweet like honey and after
~~drying, it took the form of gum. According to others, it was honey or
~~sweet water (Tafsir Ahsan-ul-Bayan). The truffle is similar to Al-Manna.
~~This means that as Banu Israel were given food without toil, so we find
~~truffle in nature without effort. The juice of truffle is useful in

# [Muslim].
# Commentary:
# 1. In this narration, certain weaknesses of the female sex have been
~~pointed out, which are natural and pertain to the woman's biology,
~~psychology and embryology.
# According to biologists, during and before menstruation, a female's
~~thought process is affected. Similarly, her pulse and blood pressure are
~~also altered. Females are also more prone to hysteria. For these
~~reasons, the Qur'an has declared that when you have to appoint or choose
~~witnesses among women, you should choose two in place of one man. Modern
~~researches have proved this rule to be correct on the basis of biology,
~~psychology and embryology.
# Again we know that physically speaking, the female has been named as
~~the weaker sex. For these reasons, females have been excused from
~~earning their livelihood. For earning livelihood, one may have to go out
~~and work hard. Women have been exempted from this duty because of their
~~biological differences and other considerations of Shari`ah. Present-day
~~women who are ignorant of Islam and modern researches are not prepared
~~to accept these scientifically and religiously proved facts. The West
~~claims equality between the sexes. But this equality has not been
~~established so far. Today all the important posts are occupied by males
~~and all the international policies are framed by them alone. Even
~~matters pertaining to women are decided by them. They have mostly
~~relegated them to the posts of workers, secretaries and stenographers
~~for their sexual satisfaction and enjoyment. After a struggle for
~~hundred years, their condition today proves that they are the weaker sex.
# So, it is both beneficial and more respectful for her to limit herself
~~to the sphere of action suggested for her by Islam. If she oversteps her
~~sphere, she will certainly lose her female dignity and prestige, as has
~~happened in the West. Her state and condition there is an eyeopener for all.
# 2. Women should request forgiveness from Allah very often and be
~~generous in charity. They should not show ungratefulness to their
~~husbands and should avoid backbiting and cursing others so that they may
~~save themselves from Hell.

# Secondly, recitation of Allah's Name will ever remain on their tongues

# Commentary:
# 1. The people in the Jannah would be similar in shape and height, etc.
~~There would be no differences between them. It won't be that one person
~~is beautiful and the other ugly or one is fair in colour and the other
~~is black. This is one view. The other view is that they would be similar
~~in being good mannered and the desirable and loving disposition. They
~~will be on the highest pedestal of ethics, etiquette, politeness and
~~morality. None of them would be immoral, discourteous or ill-tempered.
# 2. Everyone there would have two wives. They would either be from the
~~houris or from the humans. The narration, which claims that every one
~~would have seventy-two wives has a weak chain of narrators. However, in
~~one narration of At-Tirmidhi which has been claimed to be Sahih, it is
~~stated that a martyr would get seventy-two wives. (At-Tirmidhi, Chapter
~~about the Superiority of Jihad). Then the saying, "One would get in the
~~Jannah what he wants'' may also be considered and so the possibility of
~~more than two wives cannot be denied.
# 3. Hur is the plural of Howra It means white and pink. So it is said
~~that one would be bewildered to see their beauty. `Ein is the plural of
~~`Aina' It means one having large eyes like a deer. In another narration
~~it is said that if any one of them just peeps towards our earth, the
~~whole space would be filled with scent and all the space would be
~~lighted. Her sheet of cloth used to cover the head and the bosom would
~~be so precious that its cost would exceed this whole material earth.

# 850. At-Tufail bin Ubayy bin Ka`b (May Allah be pleased with him)
~~reported: I used to visit `Abdullah bin `Umar (May Allah be pleased with
~~them) in the morning and accompany him to the market. `Abdullah offered
~~greetings of peace to every one he met on the way, be they sellers of
~~petty goods, traders or poor people. One day when I came to him, he
~~asked me to accompany him to the market. I said to him: "What is the
~~point of your going to the market when you do not sell, nor ask about
~~articles, nor offer a price for them, nor sit down with any company of
~~people. Let us sit down here and talk.'' He replied: "O Abu Batn
~~(belly)! (Tufail had a large belly), we go to the market to greet
~~everyone we meet.''

# [Malik].

# Commentary: This Hadith highlights `Abdullah bin `Umar's passion for
~~promoting Salam which is a practice of Sunnah. Secondly, we can call a
~~person by his epithetic name provided he is not offended by it.

# [ ( 1 ) وهو نص في كراهة تقبيل ms407 الرجال عند اللقاء العادي . دار الحديث ]

# 888. Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man asked: "O
~~Messenger of Allah! When a man meets a brother or a friend, should he
~~bow to him?'' He said, "No.'' The man asked whether he should embrace
~~and kiss him? The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) replied, "No.'' He asked
~~whether he should hold his hand and shake it? The Messenger of Allah
~~(PBUH) replied, "Yes.''

# [At-Tirmidhi].

# Commentary: Here, we are clearly told that when two Muslims meet they
~~are not allowed to bow. Some say the bowing must not come down to the
~~position as assumed in Ruku`. But the Hadith imposes a total ban on it.
~~There is no question of more or less degree of bowing, still less of
~~touching the knees and feet of anybody. Here embracing has been
~~prohibited too, but the prohibition is effective only if the kissing of
~~hands is also involved. Otherwise, some Ahadith allow embracing,
~~particularly on return from a journey or when two persons meet after a
~~long time. Thirdly, the Hadith is absolutely clear on handshake. The
~~question put to the Prophet u was about taking a single hand to which he
~~had replied in the affirmative. There was no reference to taking or
~~using both hands for handshake.

# دار الحديث ]

# 948. `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: A man said to the
~~Prophet (PBUH): "My mother has died suddenly. I think that if she were
~~able to talk (alive) she would have given in Sadaqah (charity). So, if I
~~give Sadaqah now on her behalf, will she get the reward?'' The Messenger
~~of Allah (PBUH) said, "Yes (she will be rewarded for that).''

# [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].

# Commentary: This Hadith plainly tells us that the reward of the alms
~~given on behalf of a dead person reaches his or her soul just like the
~~benefit of prayer, if accepted by Allah. Charity and prayer are two
~~permissible forms of the transmission of blessing to the dead. But rites
~~like `Qul' and `Chehlum' are all of Hindu origin to which the ignorant
~~Muslims have taken a fancy. Similarly, Qur'an reading meant to transmit
~~reward to a dead man's soul is against the Prophet's example. All such
~~observances are of no use to the dead. Only scriptural channels can be
~~beneficial to them and they are only two - prayer and charity. But only
~~that charity counts which comes from the children of the dead and the
~~Hadith too has specified it. Obviously, almsgiving by any other person
~~than the offspring cannot be considered rightful or rewarding to the
~~dead. For further detail, one can refer to Sheikh Al-Albani's Ahkam-ul-
~~Janaiz.

# 1331. Abu Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man came to
~~the Prophet (PBUH) with a she-camel wearing a nose-string and said:
~~"This is (a gift) in the Cause of Allah.'' The Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
~~replied, "You will have in return for it on the Day of Resurrection
~~seven hundred she-camels and every one of them will be wearing a nose-
~~string.''

# [Muslim].

# Commentary: This Hadith mentions the reward which will be given on the
~~Day of Resurrection on virtues. Every virtue will be given at least a
~~ten-fold reward but it will go to the extent of seven hundred times or
~~more. Thus, this Hadith has glad tidings of a reward of seven hundred
~~times of a good action.

# 1586. Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The
~~Prophet (PBUH) said, "Every one who breaks a covenant will have a flag
~~by his buttocks on the Day of Resurrection. It will be raised higher
~~according to the nature of his breach. Behold, there will be no greater
~~a sin with respect to breaking the covenant than that of a ruler who
~~breaks his covenant with the Muslim masses.''

# [Muslim].

# Commentary: This Hadith clearly shows that breach of covenant is
~~forbidden in Islam, especially on the part of a ruler because (a) he is
~~in a position to honour his covenant, and (b) his evil can affect the
~~whole Muslim community.

# It was a custom in the Pre-Islamic Period of Ignorance in Arabia to fix
~~flags on poles for those who were guilty of breach of oath to humiliate
~~and defame them. Almighty Allah has mentioned the punishment of flags on
~~the Day of Resurrection for such people who break their covenant so that
~~people can easily understand its nature. What a humiliation that will be!

# * Placing the flag by his bottom signifies humiliation and disgrace
~~because flags are usually carried in front of the bearer not behind.
