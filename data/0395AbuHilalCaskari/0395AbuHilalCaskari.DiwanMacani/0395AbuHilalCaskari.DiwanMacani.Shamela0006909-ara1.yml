90#VERS#COMMENT##: There is a short part before each chapter that begins with “bismillah” and is a kind of introduction to that part, but it does not have any title. I tag these parts as first-level blank headers. 2- “&amp” appears instead of “salli-Allah” in the text. 3- Another edition of the book that is accessible online can be found here: https://ia600308.us.archive.org/19/items/waq72929/72929.pdf
