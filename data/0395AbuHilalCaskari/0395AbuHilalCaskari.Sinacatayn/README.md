## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

I was only able to work with the 1952 edition (more details below), in its pdf-online version and a printed 1989 version of the text which is

a reprint of the first edition of 1952.

I chose Abu Hilal al-Askari's Kitab al-Sina'atayn because of relevance to my research. 


## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

I used the above mentioned edition by ?Al? Mu?ammad al-Ba??w?, Mu?ammad Ab? l-Fa?l Ibr?h?m as uploaded on Archive.org

which is dated 1952, Publisher: Al-Maktaba al-?Asr?ya. 
There are some minor changes wth respec to to the text uploaded by Maktab Shamela, which, taken from the metadata
 has uploaded a 1998 edition/reprint of the text. I could finde some headings 
and insertions that were not in the 1952 edition.

Pagination is the same.

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)
