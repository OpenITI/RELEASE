90#VERS#COMMENT##: Converted from HTML at filaha.org, which is a
    transcription of the Dozy edition, which in turn is a transcription in
    Arabic letters of the judaeo-Arabic manuscript. The Dozy edition has the
    original manuscript readings and Dozy's suggestions for filling in
    lacunae in the the critical apparatus; the filaha.org transcription
    moved these into the text, between square brackets. I removed all these
    square brackets.
