90#BOOK#COMMENT##: The book's title and authorship is debated. "Dozy
    (1866; 1873, pp. i-viii) and Pellat (1961, introduction) believe that
    the Calendar of Cordoba has to be regarded as a conflation of two texts,
    the Kitāb al-anwā’ of ʿArīb ibn Saʿd/Saʿīd and the Kitāb tafṣīl al-azmān
    wa-maṣāliḥ al-abdān of Rabīʿ ibn Zaīd, also known as Racemundo, the
    bishop of Elvira (Granada) under ʿAbd al-Raḥmān III and Al-Ḥakam II.
    Their reasoning is based on the fact that the older of the two Latin
    translations ascribes the text to “Harib filii Zeid episcopi”,
    reconstructed as “Harib filii [Saʿd liber, cum libro Rabi filii] Zeid
    episcopi” or “ Harīb/ʿArīb, the son [of Saʿd, together with the book of
    Rabīʿ, the son] of Zaid, the bishop” (Pellat 1961, IX), while the Arabic
    text gives the title as Kitāb al-anwā’, which they take to be the
    original title of ʿArīb’s work as indicated by references in Ibn al-
    ʿAwwām (cf. Dozy, 1866, p 599f.). Lopéz (1990, p. 342f.) on the other
    hand mentions that Kitāb al-anwā’ is really the name of a literary genre
    rather than the title of an individual work and points out that the
    Arabic manuscript concludes by stating tamma kitāb ʿArīb fī tafṣīl al-
    azmān wa-maṣāliḥ al-abdān (“Here ends ʿArīb’s treatise regarding the
    detailed description of the seasons and the benefits of the bodies”). In
    his opinion, ʿArīb made use of a sanctoral calendar composed by Rabīʿ
    ibn Zaid bearing the same title, which was mentioned on the title page
    and thus led to confusion between the authors' names. The supposed use
    of this sanctoral treatise also explains the references to Christian
    saints." (http://www.filaha.org/author_ar_b_ibnsa.html).
