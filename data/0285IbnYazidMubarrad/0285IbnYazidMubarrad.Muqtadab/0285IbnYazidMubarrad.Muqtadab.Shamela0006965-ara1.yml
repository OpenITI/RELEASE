90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The edition I found seems to be a reprint of the
    edition used in Editpro text (by the same editor but different
    publisher). The only difference is that in Vol 1 of the PDFs, the
    pagination does not begin from 1, but from 141 (after the introduction);
    however, the pages are exactly the same in all volumes. 2- The book’s
    table of contents does not have any categorization for titles;
    nevertheless, some titles are obviously subtitles of some others. I
    categorized the text as long as possible; however, the titles are very
    tricky and so similar to each other that I can’t decide whether this
    title is a subcategory of that one or not. So, the level of
    categorization for the titles is probably not correct in some cases.
    Accurate categorization needs thorough reading of the text by a
    specialist in Arabic grammar.
