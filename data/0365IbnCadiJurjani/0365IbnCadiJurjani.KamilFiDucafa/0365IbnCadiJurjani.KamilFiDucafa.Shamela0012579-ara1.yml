90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH, PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: PV introduced an additional level in the structural
    tagging for the introduction and the main part of the book.  HRH tagged
    the name entries with ### $ and their subsections with # *;  PV replaced
    the name entries with ### |||| and their subsections with ### |||||.
    HRH flagged a problem with pagination in volume eight, PV was not able
    to locate these problems.  HRH flagged a few redundant lines at the end
    of PageV06P045, PV removed them (as well as a number of lines at the
    beginning of the book,  on PageV01P002, which looked like random lines
    from the editorial introduction but not found on page 2 of the edition)
