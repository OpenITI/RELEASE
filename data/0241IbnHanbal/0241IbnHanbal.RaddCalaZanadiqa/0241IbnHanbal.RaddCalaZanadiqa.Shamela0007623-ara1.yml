90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Shamela version is superior to JK version because it
    is much longer (though that includes editorial sections) and includes no
    pre-tagging of Qur'an verses. There are however some strange things
    happening with the Shamela text: it seems to be a combination of two
    different editions (it is unclear what the second edition is) but with
    bits of text missing and other parts inserted (especially subheaders). I
    have left these divergences mostly intact but restructured them where
    appropriate. Could not locate the right edition on Worldcat.
