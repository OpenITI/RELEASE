90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Electronic text is based on 平Amr 平Abd al-Mun平im
    Sal朝m's edition and is fairly clean. Individual hadith are numbered and
    grouped under headings relating to specific statements (qawl). The
    initial structural tagging took the individual hadith as main reference,
    the text has now instead been tagged based on the edition's headers.
