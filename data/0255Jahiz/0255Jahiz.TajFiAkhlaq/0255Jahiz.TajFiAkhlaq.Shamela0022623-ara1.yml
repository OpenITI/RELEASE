90#VERS#COMMENT##: Second-level headers are sorted according to what
    appears in Editpadpro version (which itself corresponds to what is
    written on the left margin of the pages), not according to the book's
    table of contents which is a very descriptive one. These lines are
    omitted in Editpadpro version: Page/Line: 20/4; 48/6; 55/11; 118-6-7-8;
    134/last line;
