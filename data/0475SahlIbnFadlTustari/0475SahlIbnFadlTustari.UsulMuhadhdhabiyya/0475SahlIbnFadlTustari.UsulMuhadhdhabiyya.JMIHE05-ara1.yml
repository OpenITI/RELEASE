90#VERS#COMMENT##: Transcription of folios 1-10 of a majmūʿa manuscript
    in Hebrew letters from the Geniza in the Firkovitch collection in Saint
    Petersburg. The beginning and end of the text are preserved in the
    manuscript,  but there is an extensive lacuna between folios 4 and 5.
    The text was extracted from an xml version of Jewish-Muslim Intellectual
    History Entangled. Textual Materials from the Firkovitch Collection,
    Saint Petersburg, edited by Camilla Adang, Bruno Chiesa, Omar Hamdan,
    Wilferd Madelung, Sabine Schmidtke and Jan Thiele,  Open Book Publishers
    2020, pp. 295-316 (see pp. 38-41 for an introduction). The pagination of
    the print version was not represented in the xml file; the pagination of
    the manuscript (National Library of Russia, YA I 3951)  is used instead.
