90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The title of the book says the text is a bibliography; however, it is a combination of bibliographical and biographical entries. To separate these two, I tagged the names of people with ### $ and the names of books with the extended tag ### $DIC_BIB$. 2- I checked all the entries to be on separate lines. 3- The sign = is placed before and after the names of some books. I didnâ€™t delete them since they might be useful for tagging the names of books inside the text. However, finally they must be deleted. 4- The text has been typed carelessly. Missing parts: Three last lines of page 50; one line in page 106; page 168 number 10 and 11; page 170 number 14; page 282; a few lines in page 334; pages 437-8; page 459; a few lines in page 512. 5- The version I used for collation is a reprint.
