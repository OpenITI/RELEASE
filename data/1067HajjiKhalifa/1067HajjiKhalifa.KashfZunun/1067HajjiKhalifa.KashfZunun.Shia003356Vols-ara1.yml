90#VERS#COMMENT##: Of the three versions of this texts in the corpus,
    the quality of this text seems to be the best.  The main problem with
    this version is that new books  do not always start on new lines. The
    Kashf is organized alphabetically; its entries  are either book titles
    or "genres"/"disciplines" (Ê¿ilm). Sometimes, a number of book titles
    belonging to a genre are mentioned under a genre heading, but not
    always. Genre headings have been given ### || tags;  the end of a genre
    subsection needs to be indicated with  an empty ### || tag.  Book titles
    have provisionally been given ### $ tags. There is still some cleaning
    work in the genre sections (marking book titles within those sections)
