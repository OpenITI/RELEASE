90#BOOK#COMMENT##: Both versions in the corpus (JK006988 and Shamela0006981)
    are based on the same edition of the text, in which the Risālat al-Ḥudūd
    was published together with the Manāzil al-ḥurūf (by the same author).
    This joint publication is also in JK and Shamela (JK001218 and Shamela 0006997), 
    which was removed from the corpus. See https://github.com/OpenITI/Annotation/issues/574
