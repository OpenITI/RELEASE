90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The book “معاني الحروف” consists of two
    manuscripts: “نسخة القدس” and “نسخة إسطمبول” (which contain different
    subjects). This text (Shamela version, which is the only version on the
    repository) just contains the “إسطمبول” manuscript. So, we need to find
    the text of the “قدس” manuscript and add it to this file (or maybe as a
    separate file to the repository). 2- Pages 169-175 of the PDF are
    missing in the text. 3- Another edition of the text that is accessible
    on the internet can be found here: https://ia902505.us.archive.org/4/ite
