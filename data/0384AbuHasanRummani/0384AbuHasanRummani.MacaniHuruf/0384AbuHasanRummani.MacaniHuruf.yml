90#BOOK#COMMENT##: The book exists in two manuscripts: 
    one in Jerusalem and one in Istanbul (Köprülü).
    (both texts are found in the Shalabī 1981 ed., 
    http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4771087611).
    The manuscripts contain entirely different texts, 
    and have different titles: The Köprülü manuscript 
    seems titled Kitāb al-ḥurūf, the Jerusalem manuscript
    starts with "qāla Abū al-Ḥasan ʿĪsā fī Kitāb manāzil al-ḥurūf."
    Both versions in the corpus contain the text of the
    Jerusalem manuscript. 
    * Shamela0005353 is an unpaginated digitization of an unidentified 
      edition, and misses a number of pages at the end.
    * Shamela0006997 and JK001218 are identical digitizations of the 
      Sāmarrā'ī edition (http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4771444716), 
      which includes, in addition to the Manāzil (sic) al-ḥurūf, 
      also a second risāla, Risālat al-Ḥudūd.
