90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- This text consists of two treatises (Risala):
    “منازل الحروف” and “رسالة الحدود”. The first treatise is exactly the
    same as “معاني الحروف” by the same author (which has been tagged:
    “0384AbuHasanRummani.MacaniHuruf.Shamela0005353-ara1”; It seems that the
    editor has published it under a different name) and the second one
    exists on the repository as a separate file (I have also tagged it:
    “0384AbuHasanRummani.RisalatHudud.JK006988-ara1”). So we have a separate
    file for each treatise and we no longer need this folder. It must be
    deleted from the repository. 2- Attention: As I explained in its yml
    file, “0384AbuHasanRummani.MacaniHuruf.Shamela0005353-ara1” lacks a few
    pages at the end of the text. Maybe we can copy and paste these missing
    pages from this redundant file into it before deleting (Although this
    redundant version is a different edition and I’m not sure if this is
    possible or not).
