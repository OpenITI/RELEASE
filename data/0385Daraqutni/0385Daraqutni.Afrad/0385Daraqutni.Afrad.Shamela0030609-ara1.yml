90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- This text is just the second part of “الغرائب
    والافراد” which is a very long text. So, I consider it an
    INCOMPLETE_VERSION (However, this second part is complete in itself; so,
    maybe it should not be considered incomplete. I’m not sure about using
    this tag here) . 2- The text consists of 51 Hadith and does not have
    anything that need to be tagged. 2- Find a manuscript of the text here:
    https://www.alukah.net/manu/files/manuscript_3136/makhtot.pdf; Moreover,
    another edition of the text (that is a PhD Thesis in Muhammad bin Sa’ud
    university) can be found here: http://www.mediafire.com/file/kh3hsc12hb9
