90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text is a transcription of four folios of a
    majmūʿa manuscript  (unidentified; pictures here:
    http://www.alathary.net/books/book.php?book_id=296) PV added the page
    numbers of the manuscript. The title states it contains a selection of
    ten of al-Dhuhlī's aḥādīth taken from the 13th part of al-Dāraquṭnī's
    collection of al-Dhuhlī's aḥādīth (named as al-fawā'id al-muntaqāt min
    al-uṣūl min ḥadīth al-qāḍī (...) al-Dhuhlī). The text starts with an
    isnād in which the most recent source is Abū al-Barakāt al-Ḥasan b.
    Muḥammad Ibn ʿAsākir (d. 627/1230,  a nephew of the author of the Tārīkh
    Dimashq, see EI2 vol. 3 p. 714f.). The text contains in fact 11 aḥādīth,
    and the last is preceded again  by an isnād in which the most recent
    source is al-Ḥasan Ibn ʿAsākir. Since this is a selection from
    Dāraquṭnī's selection,  it should perhaps not be attributed to him in
    the URI?
