90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The page numbers at the top of the pages are
    interred into the text (and that is the correct pagination for the book;
    the automatic pagination is wrong). I just untagged them. They must be
    deleted and the automatic pagination must be corrected. 2- The edition I
    used for collation is exactly the same as the Shamela edition. However,
    the numbers of Hadiths are different for no apparent reason.
