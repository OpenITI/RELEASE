90#VERS#COMMENT##: Modern reference work based on Suyuti's Jamʿ al-
    Jawāmiʿ, with additions from (see introduction, vol. 1 p. 8):  (1) al-
    Munāwī's al-Jāmiʿ al-Azhar,  (2) al-Munāwī's Kunūz al-Ḥaqā'iq,  (3) al-
    Suyuti's al-Fatḥ al-kabīr,  (4) and other texts. The order of the
    aḥādīth is also the editors'. The digitized text contains no pagination
    (PageV00P000), except in the introduction. No PDF of this specific
    edition was found. PV cleaned up the structural annotation,  as far as
    possible without access to the printed edition or PDF.
