90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- There is a title entitled “إيضاح ما يوجد فى صورة
    ...” in most sections which gives explanations about its preceding
    picture. I didn’t tag these titles because firstly, they are not bold
    and probably cannot be considered titles at all, and secondly, because
    they are just related to two or three following paragraphs, and the rest
    of the text is about the main subject, not about the picture. I just
    tagged them as paragraphs but with an asterisk (i.e. # *) so that they
    are distinguishable and can be found easily. 2- The first paragraph of
    the last page (page 528) is missing. 3- Another edition of the book that
    is accessible on the internet can be found here:
