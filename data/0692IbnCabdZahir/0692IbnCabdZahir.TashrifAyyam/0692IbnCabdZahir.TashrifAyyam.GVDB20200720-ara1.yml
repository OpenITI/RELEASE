90#VERS#COMMENT##: This text was generated through Google Drive OCR, and then formatted, cleaned up, corrected and annotated by Gowaart. The cleaning up is still in progress. Only sections marked CHECKED at the end have been closely compared to the edition, the other sections still include many typos. 
 Update 2020-10-28: cleaned up page numbers, improved paragraphs, and changed hierarchy to make year changes more clearly recognisable (following manuscript logic more so than that of the edition). I have added two such year headers in square brackets, the first one of which likely formed part of a now lost section at the start of the third volume. The last one is entirely editorial, as the following parts were clearly added to the text at a later point (they all relate to the year 689 while years 687-8 are not dealt with at all). Some typos were corrected further, but the majority of the text still need further checking. This is on Gowaart's radar and will be ongoing for a while.
