Please, copy-paste questions from `text_questionnaire.md` into this file and answer the questions.
If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

I chose the shamela version, which there was a PDF for in the url-document and which had a good structure

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

The second in urls-document.

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

no

## 4. Add any comments on the text

Text was quite unproblamatic - structure as it is now seems coherent.
From line 86619 on there was no PDF avaiblable anymore, so the last few headlines are not labbeled very well, but it might not be the most important part of the text.
