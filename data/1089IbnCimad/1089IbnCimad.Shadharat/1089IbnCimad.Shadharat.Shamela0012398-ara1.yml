90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text is a chronological history text. After shortly mentioning the main events of each year, the obituaries begin. From volume 3 onwards, there is a filled circle next to each name in the PDF. So the names are distinguishable—although they do not have numbers. In volume 2, there is no such a sign for names. Nevertheless I tagged the names in this volume as well (from page 17 onwards), because the main theme of this text is to collect obituaries and therefore annotation of this book would be useless without tagging the names. But, in volume 1, the names cannot be tagged because there is no separation between the events related to each year and the obituaries. The text is a mixture of them and therefore it’s not possible to tag the names, since they are not separable from the rest of the information in the text. The only way to tag the names in this volume is to tag them inside the lines. 2- All the names in all volumes are tagged manually since they have no numbers. 3- In volumes 9 and 10 the editor has used another manuscript for editing (see introduction to the 9th volume). 4- The text already had an issue. I tagged it at Lorenz’s request.
