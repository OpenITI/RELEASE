## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

Both the Shamela and the JK text are based on the same edition. But Shamela was much better pretagged.

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

I used the following PDFs:
https://ia802700.us.archive.org/23/items/waq50067/01_50067.pdf
https://ia802700.us.archive.org/23/items/waq50067/02_50068.pdf

The PDF is the same edition as the Shamela text. In general, pagination is the same. Although there are some problems:
- page numbers are almost missing in the Shamela text
- in some cases even the pagebreak is not corrext (I noticed around 10 cases)

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

no typos

## 4. Add any comments on the text

In the Shamela text, sometimes a single '3' or '4' stands alone (not in the PDF) and it is not cleat why. This happens mostly before or after chapter headings.
