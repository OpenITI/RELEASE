90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The original text file contained 7 short "risālas"
    (some of them short quotes) of al-Nasā'ī. They  were published together
    with al-Bukhārī's Kitāb al-Ḍuʿafā' al-ṣaghīr and al-Nasā'ī's Kitāb al-
    Ḍuʿafā' wa-al-matrūkīn. The editor does not say anything about the
    source of these small  texts, but in his introduction to al-Nasā'ī's K.
    al-Ḍuʿafā', he states that the text he based himself on is the riwāya of
    al-Nasā'ī's student Abū Muḥammad al-Ḥasan b. Rashīq, known from a
    manuscript that has Abū Muḥammad  ʿAbd al-Qādir b. ʿAbd Allāh al-Ruhāwī
    [d. 612],  as the last person in the chain of transmission,  who heard
    the text in Ramaḍān 608 AH in Ḥarrān (p. 142). Since Ibn Rashīq is
    mentioned 5 times in the isnāds of these  treatises, it is likely they
    come from the same manuscript. Zāyid's edition of al-Nasā'ī's Ḍuʿafā'
    starts with the aforementioned isnād (p. 145), and ends with the
    statement:  "ākhir al-ṭabaqāt wa-huwa ākhir juz' Ibn al-Tammār, kadhā
    qāla Abū al-Faraj Sahl b. Bashīr/Bishr al-Isfarāyinī." (p. 276) Ibn al-
    Tammār is not mentioned before, but according  to the isnād at the
    beginning of the work, this al-Isfarāyinī heard the text in Ramaḍān 474.
    It is therefore likely that the 7 risālas were in this juz', together
    with al-Nasā'ī's Ḍuʿafā'. The 7 risālas in this collection were split
    off into their own text files.
