90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- About the titles: There are two titles in
    “0303Nasai.TasmiyaManLamYarwi” folder. The first is “تسمية من لم يرو عنه
    غير رجل واحد” and the second is “مجموعة رسائل في علوم الحديث”. After
    spending a lot of time, I realized that there isn’t any book under the
    first title (“تسمية من”). This text actually consists of seven very
    short treatises and “تسمية من لم يرو عنه غير رجل واحد” is just the name
    of the first treatise. And the funny thing is that all these seven
    treatises are appendixes to a different book by the same author (i.e
    “النسائي”) entitled “الضعفاء والمتروکین” which is published together
    with Bukhari’s “الضعفاء الصغیر” by “دار الوعي” in Aleppo (first edition
    in 1396, and not 1369 as written in the Metadata). So, such a book under
    the name “تسمية من لم يرو عنه غير رجل واحد” doesn’t exist. All the four
    files on the repository under this title consist of these seven
    treatises. There are also three other files in
    “0303Nasai.TasmiyaManLamYarwi” folder whose titles are “مجموعة رسائل في
    علوم الحديث” which, again, consist of the same seven treatises! The
    editor has collected all the treatises under this title, which is the
    correct title for such a book. So, we just have one book here. 2- About
    collating: The first text doesn’t exist and I couldn’t find the second
    one “مجموعة رسائل في علوم الحديث”. I found another edition under the
    name “ثلاث رسائل حدیثیّة” by a different publisher (the first link on
    VERS#LINKS) which consists of three major treatises of these seven
    treatises. I used this edition for collating (it had a better structure
    for tagging) and for collating the other four treatises, I used the
    appendixes to “الضعفاء والمتروكون” (the second link on VERS#LINKS). The
    only missing parts in this text that need to be added are the titles of
    four of the seven treatises and a few lines at the end of the fifth
    treatise (“أحسن الأسانيد التي تروى عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم”).
