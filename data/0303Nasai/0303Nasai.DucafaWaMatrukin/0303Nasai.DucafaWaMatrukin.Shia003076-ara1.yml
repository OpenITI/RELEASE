90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text was published as an appendix to al-Bukhārī's
    Kitāb al-Ḍuʿafā' al-Ṣaghīr (not included in the Shia003076 text). In his
    introduction (pp. 133-144 in the Beirut edition),  the editor does not
    mention the manuscript(s) his edition is based on. This version should
    be the primary one, because it has been compared  to the actual edition
    (the Shamela and JK versions are based on an  older print of the same
    edition, with other page numbers)
