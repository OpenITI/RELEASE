90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This book is also included in the Bindāri 1991 edition 
    of al-Nasā'ī's al-Sunan al-Kubrā (pp. 250-265).
    It was edited separately by Muḥammad al-Saʿīd Zaghlūl.
    The JK version is the best digitized version
    of the Zaghlul edition (Shamela misses page numbers,
    Shia misses structural tagging).
    A PDF of the edition Zaghlul edition was not found, 
    but it was compared with the Dār al-Fatḥ edition (1993), 
    which has different pagination but the same 
    numbering of subsections and paragraphs.
    PV slightly adapted the structural tagging, 
    so that the first subsection is not the title of the work
    but "Ta'wīl qawl Allāh ..." (as in the Sunan).
