90#VERS#COMMENT##: This is a digital version of al-Nasā'ī's al-Sunan al-
    Ṣughrā (or Mujtabā al-sunan), edited with the sharḥ of al-Suyūṭī and the
    marginal notes of al-Sindī (the sharḥ and the marginalia were not
    digitized). Shia001740Vols follows the Dār al-Fikr edition
    (http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1158773169)  of 1930/1348 (sic; probably a
    reprint of the al-Maṭbaʿa al-Miṣriyya edition of 1930/1348,
    http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1028999263) in 8 volumes, but volumes 3 and
    7 are taken from another reprint of the same edition by Dār Iḥyā' al-
    turāth al-ʿArabī (http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/782088725). PV tagged the
    editorial sections.  The structure is not indicated by specific markers
