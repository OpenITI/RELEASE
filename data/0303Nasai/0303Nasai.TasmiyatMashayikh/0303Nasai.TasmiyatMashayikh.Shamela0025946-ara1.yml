90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text is Ibn Bassām's riwāya of al-Nasā'ī's
    mashyakha.  In his introduction (pp. 29f.), the editor lists a number of
    other students of  al-Nasā'ī who transmitted their teacher's mashyakha,
    and whose riwāyāt are  quoted by scholars like Mughulṭāy , Ibn Ḥajar,
    al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī, and others. None of these other riwāyāt are
    extant as such, but the editor states (pp. 31ff.) that Ibn Ḥajar's
    Tahdhīb and Ibn ʿAsākir's Muʿjam al-Mushtamil contain almost all of al-
    Nasā'ī's judgements about his shaykhs (although they sometimes slightly
    differ).

    The original edition also includes another risāla of al-Nasā'ī,
    Dhikr al-Mudallisīn, but this work is not included in this Shamela
    version (it is in the corpus as
    0303Nasai.DhikrMudallisin.Shamela0025868-ara1).

    The text is taken from a majmūʿa manuscript  (Riyāḍ, King Saud
    library no. 1280/2, dated 633AH)  compiled by the scholar Ibn Karīm al-
    Māsiḥ (b. 579, d. 637),  about whom al-Dhahabī writes that "he wrote
    many ajzā'". The beginning of the majmūʿa contains a juz' titled "al-
    juz' fīhi maʿrifat man rawiya ʿanhu al-shaykh al-imām ... al-Nasā'ī
    raḥmat Allāh ʿalayhi wa-ghayr dhālika".  The juz' contains  1. a list of
    al-Nasā'ī's shaykhs, on the authority of al-Nasā'ī's student Abū Isḥāq
    Ibrāhīm b. Muḥammad b. Aḥmad b. Bassām al-Miṣrī (268-354AH). 2. Three
    very short statements attributed to al-Nasā'ī  (each introduced by "qāla
    lanā Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Nasā'ī"), perhaps also on the authority of
    the same Ibn Bassām: a. about the trustworthiness of some authorities.
    b. "Dhikr man yuʿraf min al-quḍāh bi-al-ḥadīth" c. about the most
    trustworthy authorities according to al-Zuhrī The edition contains a
    full transcription of the juz'. PV has tagged the three additional
    statements attributed to al-Nasā'ī as appendix.

    In addition, the edition adds three appendices written by the editor
    himself (see editor's introduction p. 38): two lists of al-Nasā'ī's
    authorities,  and a list of people erroneously listed among his
    authorities:  a. "Tasmiyat shuyūkh al-Nasā'ī al-ladhīn lam yaridū fī
    riwāyat Ibn Bassām wa-dhakarahum Ibn ʿAsākir fī al-Muʿjam al-Mushtamil
    aw al-Ḍiyā' fī al-Awhām" b. "Asmā' shuyūkh al-Nasā'ī wa-lā awradahum Ibn
    ʿAsākir wa-lā al-Ḍiyā' al-Maqdisī" c. "Al-ladhīn dhukirū fī shuyūkh al-
    Nasā'ī ʿalā sabīl al-wahm aw al-taṣḥīf" PV has tagged these as editorial
    sections.

    PV also added the page numbers.
