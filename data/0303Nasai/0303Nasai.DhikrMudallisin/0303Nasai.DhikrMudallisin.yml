    (see the editor's preface, Ḥātim b. ʿĀrif al-ʿAwnī, Makka 1423, pp. 113-115): 
    * Su'ālāt Abī ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Muḥammad b. al-Ḥusayn b. Mūsā 
      al-Sulamī [d. 412] li-al-Dāraquṭnī (d. 385), ms. Istanbul Ahmad III 12/624:
      in this manuscript, the full text of the risāla (except one authority)
      is quoted at the end by al-Sulamī on authority of al-Dāraquṭnī 
     (the Abū al-Ḥasan in the paratext is al-Dāraquṭnī)
    * Mīzān al-Iʿtidāl, by al-Dhahabī: quotes the full text of the risāla 
      in his report on Ḥajjāj b. Arṭāh (who is mentioned in the risāla).
