90#BOOK#COMMENT##: Only part 4 of this work seems extant; the original
    number of parts is unknown, and by the 7th C AH, only this 4th part
    seems to have been extant  (editor's introduction p. 40f.) It is known
    in one majmūʿa manuscript, Escorial 1800, ff. 49-67, written in 709AH.
    it lists ḥadīths mentioned by Sufyān al-Thawrī and not by Shuʿba b. al-
    Ḥajjāj, and vice versa (editor's introduction p. 33). The extant text is
    the riwāya of al-Nasā'ī's student  Abū al-Ḥasan Muḥammad b. ʿAbd Allāh
    b. Zakariyā b. Ḥayyūya al-Naysābūrī (editor's introduction p. 37); other
    riwāyāt of the same juz' are mentioned by Ibn Ḥajar al-ʿAsqalānī, al-
    Dhahabī, and others (editor's introduction p. 38f.)
