90#BOOK#COMMENT##: This book is in fact a part of al-Nasā'ī's
    Kitāb al-Sunan al-Kubrá (ed. al-Bindārī, vol. 4 pp. 393-421).
    The editor used 6 manuscripts of al-Sunan al-Kubrá for his edition
    (see pp. 51-54) and explains his decision for the re-edition of 
    this section of the text by the many lacunae in the edition
    (p. 56)
