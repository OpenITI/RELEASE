90#VERS#COMMENT##: Edition based on 4 earlier printed editions, 
    mentioned by the editor in his introduction, pp. 7-8).
    It is not clear what witnesses these earlier editions were based on;
    but the editor does mention that the text was quoted by 
    Ibn Rajab al-Ḥanbalī in his Sharḥ ʿIlal al-Tirmidhī (pp. 231-232) 
    (see editor's introduction, p. 6).
    It is thus possible that the text is not based on a Nasā'ī original, 
    but only extracted from Ibn Rajab's Sharḥ.
    PV added structural tags and the page numbers.
