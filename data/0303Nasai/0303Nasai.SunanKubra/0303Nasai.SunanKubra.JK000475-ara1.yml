90#VERS#COMMENT##: The editor calls this work al-Sunan al-Kubrā because
    it is based on a number of manuscripts that contain sections not present
    in Kitāb al-Mujtabā / al-Sunan al-Ṣughrā (for a list, see the
    introduction pp. 5-6).

    The edition is based on a number of manuscripts (list: pp. 12-)
    containing different riwāyas of al-Nasā'ī's al-Sunan al-Kubrā,  which
    not always agree on the order of the chapters  (see, for example, vol. 3
    p. 143 and p. 258):
    * J = Medina, al-Jāmiʿ al-Islāmiyya (riwāya of Ibn al-Aḥmar)
    * T = Tetouan (riwāya of Ibn al-Aḥmar)
    * Ḥ = "al-nuskha al-Turkiyya": Istanbul, Maktabat Murād Bukhārī no.
    72 ʿumūmī (the source of the Tetouan ms.; combined riwāya of Ibn al-
    Aḥmar and Ibn al-Siyār)
    * Z/Ṣ = Cairo, Maktabat al-Azhar, no. 1963 (close to the Tetouan ms.
    => riwāya of Ibn al-Aḥmar?)
    * Ġ = "al-nuskha al-Maghribiyya": Rabāṭ, al-Khizāna al-Malikiyya no.
    5952
    * B = Rabāṭ, al-Khizāna al-Malikiyya no. 9067
    * Ẓ = Damascus, al-Maktaba al-Ẓāhiriyya no. 228 (riwāya of Ibn
    Ḥayyawayh) In addition, the editor used al-Nasā'ī's Kitāb al-Mujtabā and
    al-Mizzī's Aṭrāf as sources for his edition, and sometimes adds entire
    sections from these.

    This editor numbers the aḥādīth mentioned by al-Nasā'ī. The
    digitized version also contains a second set of numbers,  in the margin
    after every paragraph, between two backspaces,  which are not in the
    printed edition; PV has not removed them because they may be useful to
    someone. (but it is easy enough to do so: replace "\\ \d+ \\" with "").
    If paragraphs cross page boundaries, the page number of the start  of
    the paragraph is sometimes (but not always) found at the end of the
    paragraph.

    PV added the paratext at the beginning of the Sunan  from the
    Shia001964Vols digitization of the same edition.

    The two main manuscripts (J and Ġ) end with the Kitāb ʿamal al-yawm
    wa-al-layla  (no. 81 in his counting). They miss nos. 82 (Tafsīr) and 83
    (al-Īmān),  the former of which is present in the riwāya of Ibn
    Ḥayyawayh (see vol. 6 p. 282 fn. 1), and the latter is absent in all
    mss. and was added by the editor  from al-Sunan al-Ṣughrā (see vol. 6 p.
    539 fn. 1).  PV has kept the former in the digitized text for now, but
    they may have to be removed; he marked the latter as editorial section
    (### |EDITOR|).

    The edition contains a number of sections and books that are not in
    al-Sunan al-Kubrā,  and of which the editor states that he added it from
    [al-Sunan] al-ṣughrā,  "for completeness". PV has marked these books as
    an editorial section (### |EDITOR|).
    * vol. 3 p. 259
    * vol. 3 pp. 336-337
    * vol. 4 pp. 249-250
    * Kitāb al-Īmān wa-sharā'iʿhā (vol. 6, pp. 527-539)
