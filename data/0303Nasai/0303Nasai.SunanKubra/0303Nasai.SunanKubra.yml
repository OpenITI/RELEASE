90#BOOK#COMMENT##: A selection of aḥādīth. Al-Nasā'ī's reportedly
    later published a selection of aḥādīth from his collection, 
    which became known as al-Sunan al-ṣughrā or Kitāb al-mujtabā.
    According to Sezgin (GAS 1: 167-168), al-Sunan al-kubrā
    may never have circulated, and all extant manuscripts, 
    regardless of the title they carry (be it al-Sunan al-kubrá, 
    al-Sunan al-Ṣughrá, or al-Mujtabá), contain the same text.
    The editor of the text published it under the title al-Sunan al-Kubrá
    because the manuscripts his edition is based on contain a large number
    of sections not present in al-Mujtabá.
