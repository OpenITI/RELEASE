90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The Editpro edition cannot be found because there
    is no data in the METADATA section to show which edition it is. Although
    the edition I have used here for collation is different, it is very
    similar to the text and I didn’t see major changes. 2- The text itself
    has very few random titles. So, the only way to give a structure to the
    text is to use the Table of contents that is created by the editor in
    the beginning of the PDF. I added blank headers (as well as numbers) to
    their respective places in the text. The titles in the Table of contents
    must be added in front of these blank headers (I didn’t do this since
    I’m not allowed to add text to the file).
