90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text has been digitised via Google OCR and due to the
    PDF's sub-optimal quality it was collated closely with the pdf by
    Gowaart. Some typos may remain however. I have taken some small
    liberties with the edition where I know it renders the manuscript
    incorrectly. I have also emmended punctuation somewhat to be more
    consistent with the rhyme scheme, as I am planning to use this for
    analysis. The editor generally followed this logic but was not always
    consistent. Some hierarchy has been introduced in the headers, but the
    text does not actually clearly signpost this and many of the headers are
    also editorial additions (differentiated by square brackets), so the
    hierarchy is largely based on a study of the contents.
