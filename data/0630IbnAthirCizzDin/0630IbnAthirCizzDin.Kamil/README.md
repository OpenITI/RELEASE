## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

A matiching PDF was available - Headers were mostly marked already in the document - remark: 11th Volume is missing in the document

## 2. Add any comments on the text

I structured the headers into three layers of which the third one is not listed in the table of contents

I wasnt sure how headlines on page 197, 275, 297 & 473 V4 p79 98 269 375 383  fitted into the structure -> they are not in the table of contents, but appear as headlines

between V2p84 and p132 there are pages missing in the markdown file
