90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text is a catalogue of manuscripts. I tagged the
    names of the manuscripts with ### $ (as a simplified tag for book titles
    which should ultimately be replaced by the complete form: ###
    $DIC_BIB$). First I tagged these names as second-level headers, but then
    I realized some of these headers include the names of more than one
    manuscript (successive name entries are tagged with an asterisk: ### $
    *). So I tagged them with the simplified tag for book titles because
    (I think) each name should be tagged separately and itâ€™s not a good idea
    to have one title with the names of 3-4 manuscripts. 2- The sign = which
    appears between the names of the manuscripts in some entries in the PDF
    (probably to show that the manuscript has two names or to add
    explanations sometimes) was missing. I added this sign to the entries
    based on what appears in the PDF.
