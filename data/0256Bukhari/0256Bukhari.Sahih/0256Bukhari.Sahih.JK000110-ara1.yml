90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The version I used for collation is a reprint of
    the digital version, but with a newer edition. So, the page numbers and
    also the numbers of the titles are different. 2- In many of the titles,
    there are one or more sentences after the titles which are sometimes
    part of the titles, and are sometimes separated as new paragraphs. The
    text is very inconsistent about this. I just followed the PDF in this
    respect (if the sentence is bold, I tagged it as the continuation of the
    title, and if not, I separated it as a new paragraph). However, a
    specialist who reads the text carefully might decide to make the titles
    coherent by adding this part to all titles or removing it from the
    titles in all cases.
