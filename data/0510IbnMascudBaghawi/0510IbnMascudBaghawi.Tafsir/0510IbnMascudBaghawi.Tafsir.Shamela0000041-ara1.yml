90#VERS#COMMENT##: I have used the 1409 edition while the text is based
    on 1417 edition (for which I couldnâ€™t find the WorldCat link, and this
    is why the two WorldCat links are the same). This probably explains why
    the place of Quranic verses is different in some pages; anyway, this has
    no effect on the consistency of the text.
