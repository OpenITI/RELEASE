# Please, answer the following questions about the text that you work on

[[Last update: August 15, 2016]]

Copy-paste these questions into the README.md file and answer them.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

MGR: There is only one version; based on a printed edition (SBS has it);

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

SBS's edition; I have not encountered any typos in the sample that I was prepping for OCR training --- reproduction is very close to the edition; division into paragraphs (i.e. lines) is messy, but it is easily fixable with a script (by removing paragraphs where line does not end with a period)

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

None so far; some punctuation is missing, compared to the printed edition (mainly the flowery brackets that highlight Qur'anic verses).

## 4. Add any comments on the text
