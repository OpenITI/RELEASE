If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

Both text fit the pdf that I found (which doesn't contains table of contents), the one that I used has all or allmost all headlines & proper names (or chains of delivery?) marked. The other document seems more suitable in the first moment because it has all headlines tagged already, but it lacks the proper names

## 2. Add any comments on the text

- all headlines are tagged first level could't make out any hierarchy among them
- table of contents was missing so I just checked the completness of the headlines randomly -> it seems like none is missing.
