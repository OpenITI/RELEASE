Please, copy-paste questions from `text_questionnaire.md` into this file and answer the questions.
If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

- table of contents found which fits could be found( for some reason the text doesn't fits)
- headlines and proper names marked already

## 2. Add any comments on the text

- only one headline in the first level 
- maybe some strucural tags can still be made on the first 12 page -> this was difficult because of missing pdf.
