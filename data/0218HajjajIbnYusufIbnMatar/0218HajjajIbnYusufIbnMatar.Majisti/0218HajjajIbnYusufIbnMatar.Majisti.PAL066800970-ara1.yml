90#VERS#COMMENT##: Transcription of the Leiden ms. (Or. 680) of al-
    Ḥajjāj's translation of the Almagest by Josep Casulleras
    (https://ptolemaeus.badw.de/team/9).  Text digitized by the Ptolemaeus
    Arabus et Latinus project at the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften.
    Both transliteration and photographs are available on the link above.
    The text was converted to OpenITI mARkdown by PV. New lines in the
    manuscript are indicated in the transcription with `//` The manuscript
    uses circles to divide sections;  these were transcribed in the
    transcription with ❊ (`U+274A : EIGHT TEARDROP-SPOKED PROPELLER
    ASTERISK`; cannot be rendered in many fonts).  PV has kept these
    characters in the mARkdown version,  but they could perhaps better be
    replaced by paragraph marks `# `. Arabic characters representing a
    number  (or points on a line in geometrical explanations) are overlined
    in the manuscript and tagged as `<u class="num">` in the
    transliteration;  PV has tagged these characters with a `@NUM@` tag.
