90#VERS#COMMENT##: The link in VERS#LINKS that I have used for collation
    (and is exactly the same as the digital edition) leads you to a payment-
    based website and you must have an account to see the contents. 2- For
    several hours, I tried to understand which tribe is the descendant of
    which one and categorize the tribes according to their relations. It is
    really not possible. The categorization will go up until tenth-level
    headers and it will take inordinate amount of time to understand these
    relations. So, I tagged all tribes as parallel (second or third-level)
    headers. Only a specialist in the science of Ansab (genealogy) might be
    able to present a correct categorization of these tribes, and only after
    spending a huge amount of time.
