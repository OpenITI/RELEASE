90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- There must be a number after each biographical tag
    which must be added by RegEx. 2- A few of the numbers could not be
    considered biographical tag (in my view), since they include more than
    one name. I tagged them with an asterisk (i.e. ### $ *) so that they are
    distinguishable. 3- The editorial section at the end of the book is the
    note of the scribe.
