90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- Redundant parts: a few redundant lines in
    PageV01P375-6; PageV05P413 number 1915; A few lines in PageV09P467;
    Numbers 2344-2349 in PageV08P512 are repeated. I just untagged these
    redundant numbers (Iâ€™m not allowed to delete anything). 2- Numbers
    737-747 in PageV08P166 ff appear in wrong order and NO 2233 in
    PageV08P488 is lost, but these are the mistakes in the PDF, not the
    text. 3- A lot of numbers were not automatically tagged. I checked all
    numbers and tagged all of them. 4- From PageV02P039 onwards (i.e. the
    beginning of alphabetical order of names), all titles are subcategories
    of the previous title (in PageV02P037); so the alphabetical order starts
    with third-level header; but this has cause the categorization to go up
    until 7th-level header. To avoid this, one suggestion is that we can
    restart tagging the alphabetical characters from first-level header.
    However, this needs the opinion of a specialist and I didn't do it.
