90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- Redundant parts: a few redundant lines in
    PageV01P375-6; PageV05P413 number 1915; A few lines in PageV09P467;
    Numbers 2344-2349 in PageV08P512 are repeated. I just untagged these
    redundant numbers (Iâ€™m not allowed to delete anything). 2- Numbers
    737-747 in PageV08P166 ff appear in wrong order and NO 2233 in
    PageV08P488 is lost, but these are the mistakes in the PDF, not the
    text. 3- A lot of numbers were not automatically tagged. I checked all
    numbers and tagged all of them. 4- PageV09P467 and PageV01P375 are the
    notes of the scribe. 6- The categorization is continued until sixth-
    level header. 7- From PageV02P039 onwards (i.e. the beginning of
    alphabetical order of names), all titles are subcategories of the
    previous title (in PageV02P037); so they must actually start with
    fourth-level header; but this will cause the categorization to go up
    until 8th-level header. So, I restarted tagging the titles from second-
    level header.
