90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The second part of the PDF (“طبقات علماء افريقية”)
    is written by another author (“الخشني”) and has been extracted from the
    text (it must have been added as a different text into the repository).
    2- The text has been typed carelessly. I found some missing parts in the
    text (like the first paragraph in page 25 and the first paragraph in
    page 26). Moreover, some words have been added to the text that do not
    appear in the PDF.
