## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

I chose the Shamela version because it was much better pretagged than the JK version.


## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

I compared the Shamemal version to the following edition:

https://archive.org/download/FP62515/01_65215.pdf
https://archive.org/download/FP62515/02_62516.pdf
https://archive.org/download/FP62515/03_62517.pdf
https://archive.org/download/FP62515/04_62518.pdf
https://archive.org/download/FP62515/05_62519.pdf

The text was quite close although some headings were missing in the PDF (tagged as Level I). Pagination was the same.

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

Several names were misspelled in the Shamela version. For example 'Sulayman' instead of 'Salman' or 'Al Mufaddal' instead of 'Al Fadl. 
And somtimes 'ya' instead of 'hamza'. In total, I noticed approx. 20 misspellings of names.
Most mistakes were in Volume 5.

## 4. Add any comments on the text

It was easy to fix the structure of the text by use of Regular Expression (it took only some minutes). But it took me more than 8 hours to find all biographies that were not pretagged. In Vol. 1-4 approximately every fourth biography was missing and in Volume 5 nearly every second biography.
