If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

Jonas Köpsel: Only Shamela version available. 

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

Jonas Köpsel: See urls. Text is close to the edition. Pagination is the same - there are sometimes smaler differences (short parts missing, numbering of names is not existant in the text...)
Cornelia Neubauer: pagination is not always the same: in Volume 1 the pagination of the last 10 pages is incorrect; pagination in Volume 3 is shifted by one page until the end of the Volume (this starts at the PDF page 387 which is still page 386 in Shamela version); no change of the pagebreak;
some additional parts in the Shamela version (for example headings and text parts that are not mentioned in the PDF but I noticed less than 10 on of these cases)

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

Cornelia Neubauer: I noticed less then 10 typos in all Volumes. Some of the names (biographies) in the Shamela version do not correspond exactly to the PDF (parts of the names are either missing or additional, for example "mu'amar taj al-din" (Shamela) instead of "mu'ammar al-din' (PDF) )

## 4. Add any comments on the text

Jonas Köpsel: Started working on the text accidentialy (it's not listed in the priority list). 
-> I stopped working on it when I found out about it (~20 % done).
The tagging is quite time consuming, because many proper names are not marked.
Until the bibliographilcal entry 337 only 331 are tagged (6 are missing)

Jonas Köpsel: Restarted tagging again on the 03.10.2017
- 1. volume fertig

Cornelia Neubauer: I continued tagging Vol 1-5 and found in total 293 wrongly tagged biographies;
