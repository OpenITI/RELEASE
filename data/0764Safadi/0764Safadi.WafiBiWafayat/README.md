# Please, answer the following questions about the text that you work on

[[Last update Maxim: August 15, 2016]]
[[Last Update Jonas: July 14, 2017]] -> finished working on the text
 

Copy-paste these questions into the README.md file and answer them.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

MGR: chose JK version; they are all identical; based on the same edition; formatted in the same manner, but JK has more tags already in place; I am under impression that Shamela and Shia versions are based on JK

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

Ahmad Arnaut / Turki Mustafa (metadata in each text file); texts is an exact reproduction of the edition, although structural elements are not always formatted; pagination is the same.

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)
Reproduction is very clean; I have not run into any typos, although there must be --- the book is almost 30 volumes.

JoK: Found for instance:الأمام instead of الإمام
حرث instead of حارث
وثلث ماية
PageV03P087 | PageV10P083
 -> wrong page break
entry 185 او instead of ابو
entry 3871 completly missing (headline and text)

+ many similar mistakes some as well in the headlines -> I did not correct them

## 4. Add any comments on the text

The formatting is quite messy; it will take a while to mARkdown this book ...

JoK:

The structure of the text is always:
Letters -> ### |
clusters of people with the same first names  -> ### || (sometimes there were more marked than in the PDF, but if they seemed to fit the logic anyways I didn't delete them.
ألقاب -> ### ||
### $ -> biographical entries

The work is secmented into two parts: The first one until the middle of volume 5 is not in alphabetical order. The second part starting afterwards is in alphabetical order. The first part took a lot of time, as is wasn't possible to use regular expressions effectivly and the formating was very messy, in the second part most entries are tagged correctly, but not a 100% and in some Volumes all or a big number of entries were missing.

Following I made an overview of the volumes I worked on. I always listed which entries were included and how many I marked of the total. There is always the possibility, that the number is correct because the number of missed out entries and additional ones are the same, but over all the quality should be good as in 90% of the cases I have gone through all of the entries manually. If not I wrote it down 

1V: 238/248 of names were marked -> exact number of entries marked
2V: (249 - 854) 357/606 -> exact number of entries marked
3V:(855-1455) (65/600) -> 9 missing
4V: (1456-1956)(493/500) -> 7 missing
5V: (1957-2353)(___ /396) 
new part (entries start from number 1 again:
(1-87) -> all found
6V: (87-599) (513/512) -> one entry too much - did some probes and the pdf and the tagged entries seemed to fit well overall
V7:(601-1062)(463/461)-> one entry to much - everything else same as V6
V8:(1063-1568) (506/505)-> one entry too much.
second half of the text checked in detail, in the first half there seemed to be very few misstakes only, so I just probed
V9:(1569-2113) (552/554)-> two too less
V10:(2114-2642) (423/528) -> 5 entries too little, actually I have checked every single entry, but it seemed I missed out some.
V11: (2643-3258) (615/615) -> exact number of entries marked.
V12:(3259-3646) (398/387) -> 11 entries too much / checked manualy so I dont really know why the difference is so high.
V13:(3647-4254) (607/607) -> exact number of entries marked
V14:(4255-4575) (318/320) -> two missing
V15: (4576-5234) (658/660) -> two missing
V16: (5235-5963)(727/728) -> one missing
V17:(5964-6557)(591/593) -> two missing
V18: (6558-7125) (572/567) -> five too much
V19: (7126-7696) (572/570) -> two too much
V20:  (1-322) (320/322) -> two missing
V21: (1-317)(313-317) -> four missing
V22: (1-373) (374/373)-> one too much
V23: missing
V24: (1-105) (1-223) (1-129) (1-44)  439/496 -> 57 missing (due to missing pages)
pagination on page 167/68 is wrong, page 105-145 missing
V25: missing
V26: (1-53) (53/53) -> exact number of entries marked
V27: 1-483 489 / 483 -> six too much
V28: (1-92)(92/92) -> exact number found
V29:(1-232) (231/232) -> one missing


JoK: page 62-96 V1 are missing
page 62 and 61 are missing therefore 6 biographies are not included
entry 1461 is missing
