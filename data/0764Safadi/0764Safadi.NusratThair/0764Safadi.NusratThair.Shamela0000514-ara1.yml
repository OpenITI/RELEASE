90#VERS#COMMENT##: Pagination is different from pdf, much longer pages,
    possibly based on a reprint (or possibly the present one is a reprint,
    unclear from the pdf). But paragraphs seem to be the same. Poetry has
    been tagged. The headers are all editorial additions, they are in square
    brackets in the pdf and they use modern terminology that would not
    typically be used by someone like Safadi. I have reintroduced the square
    brackets to make this clear. Here and there some hierarchy is
    discernible through the contents, but as properly applying this would
    require reading the text in detail, I have not applied any hierarchy and
    simply left all headers at level 1.  Text is generally of good quality,
    but there is a large gap in the text at line 4033, pages 289-305 of the
    pdf are not included in the digital text. This gap is also present in
    the JK file (which appears to be identical to the Shamela file). I have
    left a note in the body text where this gap occurs.
