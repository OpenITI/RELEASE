90#BOOK#COMMENT##: An astronomical work, "compiled in Ṣanʿā’, Yemen
    during the rule of the Zaydī imam al-Manṣūr bi-Allāh Ḥusayn ibn al-
    Qāsim" (http://www.filaha.org/almanac_yusuf_al_mahalli.html). "The
    introduction is mainly a justification for studying astronomy (...) the
    first six pages focus on judicial astrology (aḥkām) (...). This is
    followed by a two page chart of what is beneficial in diet and health
    for each season of the year. This is standard seasonal lore not directly
    related to Yemen. Next are several page charts, including an
    illustration of a lunar eclipse forecast for the month of Dhū al-Ḥijja
    in 1145 A.H., a discussion of the visibility of Sirius (al-shiʿrā) in
    Yemen and what that portends for the year, lucky and unlucky star
    positions, and the movement of the sun. The last part of the text (ff.
    10b-22b) is an almanac chart (...). The almanac chart is constructed day
    by day on the basis of the Seleucid Christian solar calendar, starting
    with the vernal equinox. (...) Information in the almanac tables is
    contained in charts (folios 10b-22b), with each folio spread containing
    28 columns.  The contents of these columns, from right to left, are
    summarized below as given along the top of the first chart: 1.  aḥkām
    al-mamāzijāt:  this section is written as a single column containing
    generic predictions about events during the zodiacal month.  2.
    tawqīʿāt:  This section records specific data about the seasons,
    calendrical correlations, agricultural activities and the like, as
    edited and translated below. 3.  asāmī ayyām al-usbūʿ:  Arabic names of
    the days of the week 4.  al-ʿadad min Shawwāl sannat 1145:  numbers of
    the days in the Hijri month of Shawwāl in 1145 A.H. 5.  al-ʿadad min
    Baramhāt sannat 1449:  numbers of the days in the month of Baramhāt in
    1449 of the Coptic calendar. 6.  al-ʿadad min Ādhār Rūmī sannat 2044:
    numbers of the days in the month of Ādhār in 2044 of the Seleucid
    Christian solar calendar. 7.  al-ʿadad min Shahrīwarmāh sannat 1102:
    numbers of the days in the month of Shahrīwarmāh in 1102 of the
    Yazdigard reckoning of the Persian calendar. 8-15.  ḥarakāt al-kawākib
    fī al-burūj:  star movements in the zodiacal houses. 16.  ḍill al-zawāl
    aqdām wa-daqā’iq:  noon shadow length in feet and minutes. 17.  asāmī
    ayyām al-usbūʿ: Arabic names of the days of the week, repeated here
    because it is the first column of a new page. 18.  al-ʿadad min Shawwāl:
    numbers of the days in the Hijri month of Shawwāl 19.  manāzil al-qamar:
    stations of the moon (for each day). 20.  burūj al-qamar:  zodiacal
    houses of the moon (for each day). 21-26.  ittiṣāl al-qamar bi-al-
    kawākib:  conjunction of the moon with moving stars or planets. 27.  al-
    mumāzzajāt: mixed fortunes 28.  al-ikhtiyārāt al-qamarīya: recommended
    acts based on the moon."
