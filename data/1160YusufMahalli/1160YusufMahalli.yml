90#AUTH#COMMENT##: "The author Yūsuf ibn Yūsuf al-Maḥallī, as noted by
    historian David King (1983:45) in his survey of Yemeni astronomical
    treatises, is surrounded by a certain amount of confusion. This
    scholar’s name is recorded as Yūsuf ibn Yūsuf al-Maḥallī al-Shāfi‘ī al-
    Ash‘arī in a copy he made in Ṣan‘ā’ of an earlier 13th century zīj by
    Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr al-Kawāshī. King suggests that our author is
    identical to the Egyptian astronomer Yūsuf Kalārjī and that the nisba is
    in reference to al-Maḥalla in the Nile Delta. If so, he was a student of
    the Egyptian astronomer Riḍwān Efendī and apparently traveled to Crete
    and Mecca as well. In the absence of any biographical information from
    Yemeni sources, I agree with King that al-Maḥallī was no doubt an
    itinerant Egyptian scholar, who probably arrived in Yemen after the year
    1133/1721, when there is the last evidence of work he completed in
    Egypt. His main extant work in Yemen is dated during the period from
    1143-1147 AH with a mark of ownership in his name recorded in a
    manuscript as late as 1157/1744. In theory it is possible to derive the
    nisba from a Yemeni origin, although there are no direct references to
    him in the Yemeni biographical texts. For example, there is a Yemeni
    village called al-Miḥilla, located about fifteen miles north of the
    central Yemeni town of Dhamār (Qadi Ismā‘īl al-Akwa‘ 1988:256, note 4).
    This town receives a mention in Yāqūt’s early 13th century gazetteer and
    is located near an important center of learning. There is also a village
    known as al-Maḥalla south of Ibb in Wadi Suḥl (al-Maqḥafī 1985). If our
    author had been born in Yemen, he may have received his education at the
    famous Shamsīya madrasa in Dhamār. As Qadi Ismā‘īl al-Akwa‘ (1980:369)
    laments in his historical treatment of this school, most of the scholars
    there do not have formal recorded biographies. The evidence suggests,
    however, that al-Maḥallī was not born and trained in Yemen, but came
    from Egypt." (http://www.filaha.org/almanac_yusuf_al_mahalli.html)
