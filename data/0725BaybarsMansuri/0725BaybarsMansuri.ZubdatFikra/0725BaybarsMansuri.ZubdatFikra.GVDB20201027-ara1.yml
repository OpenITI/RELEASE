90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text has been digitised via Google OCR and annotated
    by Gowaart. The pdf was of good quality so the OCR is fairly reliable,
    but there are still many mistakes, some of which were corrected when I
    spotted them, but it would be a lot of work to go through the entire
    text. The text has been annotated with simplified mARkdown. Poetry and
    obituaries have been tagged.  This was until recently the only published
    volume of an originally 10-volume universal chronicle. It is the final
    volume of the chronicle, dealing with Mamluk history up until the
    author's time. Manuscripts of most of the other volumes have been
    preserved but not edited (but see below). The manuscripts on which the
    present edition was based have not been preserved in their entirety and
    are cut off in the year 709. The editor has added an appendix with
    material from these years quoted by the later historian
    0855BadrDinCayni. I have not digitised this appendix, but it could be
    added later on if so desired. It seems that another part of the
    chronicle has also been published (dealing with the sixth and seventh
    century AH) by Umar Tadmuri (http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/955672256),
    but I have not found a pdf of this. It appears that this is not based on
    the surviving manuscripts of the original chronicle, however, but on
    quotations by Ibn al-Furat and al-Yafici.
