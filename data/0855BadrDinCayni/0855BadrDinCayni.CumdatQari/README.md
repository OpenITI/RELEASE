Please, copy-paste questions from `text_questionnaire.md` into this file and answer the questions.
If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

All were quite similar to me. pagination, structure, length, so I just chose shamela by chance

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

pagination is the same 

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

-It happens that there are paragraphs which appear 2 times in a row for example
V11P66 or V14P245 )
- several spellig mistackes
for instance:
- ياي بدل بابV5P63
- strange numbering, numbers are turned around, but also dont always follow this logic. 
- sometimes paragraphes are missing e.g. V18 page 13, V23 P223, V23P285

## 4. Add any comments on the text

Finally this text was quite messy. Now it's good overall, still the quality of the result was hard to estimate, as the numbering of the entries is very messy. Some paragraphes are doubled some are missing. The structure I implemented is
### = for every new volume
### | for kitaab or suura
### || mainly for baab
### $ for what I supose where bibligrafical entries all introduced by hadthanaa...
There are some headlines intruduced by qaala. If they seem realevant, there should be some more work done to find and systamize them. I wasn't sure in how far they were relevant.
