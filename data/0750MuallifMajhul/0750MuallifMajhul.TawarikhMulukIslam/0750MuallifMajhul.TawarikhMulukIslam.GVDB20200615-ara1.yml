90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This text was typed by Gowaart, based on a unique
    composite manuscript held by the French National Library (MS Arabe
    2309). It only corresponds to the last folios of the manuscript, as the
    other folios of the manuscript contain a selection from the Ikhwan al-
    Safa and should thus rather be filed under another URI. The identity of
    the author or compiler of this material is not known. I have stayed
    close to the manuscript's orthography, so there are a lot of defective
    spellings. I have used an alternative pagination system to account for
    recto-verso of folios. The text consists a historical list and two
    diplomatic letters.
