1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

The other lacked volumes.

2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

Edition was close, but sometimes pages didn't match.
3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

Text lacked numbering of biographies.
4. Add any comments on the text
