90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This is the result of an OCR process with Google
    Drive, corrected manually.  The edition is based on one defective
    manuscript copy and includes  additions from two later authors Nuwayri
    and Maqrizi who quote  the text. These additions are rendered between
    square brackets.  The edition also used round brackets for words and
    phrases that  only appear in the manuscript. I have deleted these latter
    round  brackets to avoid confusion with the square brackets.  The
    variations from the later versions of the text will be easily  visible
    via passim results anyway. The edition also includes a second  very
    short text from the same manuscript  (a prose praise of a prominent
    member of the dynasty),  which I have included here as they clearly
    belong together.  The edition additionally includes dozens of excerpts
    from other  sources on the same subject, but I have not digitised these,
    as they are not directly related to this text.
