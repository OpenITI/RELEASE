90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- I used the first link in VERS#LINKS for collation
    which is exactly the same edition as the Shia edition; but it leads you
    to a payment-based website and you must have an account to see the
    contents. So, I provided the second link which is a reprint of the first
    one. 2- The two volumes of the book appear in reverse order in Editpro
    text. First, we see the second volume and after that the first volume
    appears. The number of the volumes in pagination must also be corrected
    after changing the place of the two volumes.
