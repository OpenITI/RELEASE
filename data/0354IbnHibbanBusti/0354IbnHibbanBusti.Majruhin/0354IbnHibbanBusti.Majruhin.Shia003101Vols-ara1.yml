90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The quality of the digital text is generally poor,
    and contains many typos. Sham19Y0151099 should become the primary version of the text.
    The JK and Shamela versions have automatic tags for
    names and are better for annotation; nevertheless the first 96 pages are
    missing in both of them and HRH had no choice but to annotate the Shia
    version that lacked any automatic tag. So HRH tagged all the names by
    hand. 
    2- The edition HRH used for collation is exactly the edition
    that is used in the Shia version. So, the information of the PDF can be
    used to complete the information in the METADATA section (that is
    incomplete). 
    3- Pages 273-276 are missing. 
    4- The editorial section at the end of the book is the note of the scribe. 
    5- Two other editions of the book can be found here: 
    https://archive.org/details/waq44014 and
    https://www.almeshkat.net/book/13138.
