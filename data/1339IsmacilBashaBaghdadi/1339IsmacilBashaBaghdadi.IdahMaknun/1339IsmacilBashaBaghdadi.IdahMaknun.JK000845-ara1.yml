90#VERS#COMMENT##: The version I used for collation is a reprint. 2- I put each name on a separate line. 3- I showed all kinds of commentaries to the books (“شرح”, “حاشية”, …) as a paragraph with an asterisk (# *; They are not part of the structure of the text. I just wanted them to be distinguishable). 4- PageV02P204-5 were duplicated. I deleted them. PageV02P45-6 are missing (PageV02P275-6 are duplicated in their places).
