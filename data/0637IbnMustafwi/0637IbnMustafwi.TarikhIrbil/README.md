## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

Version was choosen, because the PDF fits and the text is already pre-structured quite well. Both doesnt applies to the other text

## 2. Add any comments on the text

- structure not really statisfing yet 
- the numbered entries in the second volume might be marked as proper names
- more than two structural levels might be useful one for main header second for all other headers in the table of contents & third for entries not listed in the table of contents
- numbers after chapters beginning with الترجمة are often missing, but it seemed two much work to fix it
