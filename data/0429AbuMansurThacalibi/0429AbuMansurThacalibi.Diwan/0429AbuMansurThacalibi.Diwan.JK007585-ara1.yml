90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The digital text does not include pages 87 onwards of the PDF and is incomplete. 2- The only thing that needs to be tagged in this Divan is the alphabetical letters that show the alphabetical order of the last letter of the rhyme-words (i.e. “حرف رويّ”), and I tagged them as first-level blank headers.
