# Please, answer the following questions about the text that you work on

[[Last update: August 15, 2016]]

Copy-paste these questions into the README.md file and answer them.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

The JK version barely has any tags and seems to be based on a different edition? I was able to connect the Shamela version with the 1961 editon of Dar Ihya al-kutub al-'arabiya. The year and publisher don't match, but the editor does.

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

See previous q.

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

Type your response here.

## 4. Add any comments on the text
