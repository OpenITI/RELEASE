## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

Only available.

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

Dar al-sahaba li-l-turath 1995. Same as digitized.

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

Type your response here.

## 4. Add any comments on the text


53-54 not in edition.

e.g. 263-264 shows verses differently from e.g. 206-207
