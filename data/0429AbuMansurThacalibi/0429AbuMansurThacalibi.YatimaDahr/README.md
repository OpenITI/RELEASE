## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

All three texts are based on the same edition of which PDFs are available. The Shia version has virtually no mark up. In some regards, the JK version is better, for example it has correctly identified Quran verses and around PageV01P056 uses a chapter heading instead of a biography heading. However, much further in the document it failed to identify subchapters, whereas the Shamela version has those. It will be quicker to mark up the Shamela version, assuming that the Quran verses can still be automatically identified.


## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

Same pagination for the 1986 edition of Dar al-kutub al-ilmiya


## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

In more than a few cases alif without hamza and alif with hamza are mixed up. There are a few additional typos. Sometimes whole pages are missing. Many vol./pag. numbers are missing.

## 4. Add any comments on the text


line 2695 as a (wrong) page number inside it

line 2893, page 178, it really says 34, not 24

Line 5335, I don't think it should be a header and it shouldn't be tagged.

Line 5895, page 333. Half a page missing.

8460 page number missing

8804 indeed skips to 40.

9432-9433: page 518 entirely skipped

9550 still page numbers missing

10067 The "8-" is missing

10359 احمد instead of أحمد
