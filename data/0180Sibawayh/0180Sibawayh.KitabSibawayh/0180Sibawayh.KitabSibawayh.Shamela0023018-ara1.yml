90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This edition includes some of the marginal commentary
    by al-Akhfash al-Awsat according to Schoeler "The genesis of Literature
    in Islam", p. 89. This may be either in footnotes or in the body text, I
    haven't checked this. Poetry has been tagged, including half-lines where
    I spotted them. Titles have been put on one line. I have kept all
    headers at first level, but there may actually be a subdivision from
    v03p192 onwards, although if I understand correctly from the footnote,
    this is a volume-division taken from the Bulaq edition. Someone with a
    better understanding of the text might want to impose some hierarchy
    here.  REDUNDANT_PARTS: Lines 13351-13373 do not appear at this place in
    the pdf and create an abnormally long page. I have noticed no other
    obvious gaps (but also wasn't looking for one), so this part may need to
    be deleted.  The PDF page order was messed up between pages 260-290 of
    the second volume (these pages are substituted by later pages which
    appear again further on in the pdf) so I have annotated according to
    textual logic here.  Text is generally of pretty good quality, but I
    came across a few small cases of word variation between pdf and digital
    text: line 50 has akhadha-hu instead of rawa-hu. Line 406 "akhir" is not
    part of pdf. Also quite often the chapter-titles are just "bab" in the
    digital text, but in the PDF most often you find "hadha bab". This last
    divergence is especially present in the fourth volume. I have also
    spotted a few typos here and there.
