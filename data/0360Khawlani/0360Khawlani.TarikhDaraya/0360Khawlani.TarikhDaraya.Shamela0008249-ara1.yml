90#VERS#COMMENT##: The edition I have used for collation is exactly the
    same as the Shamela edition; however, I noticed a few changes. The
    Riwaya part is different in a few cases in Editpro text (see for
    instance the last line in page 115 of the PDF) and there seems to be
    some changes made by the editor/typist (like the first paragraph in page
    102). 2- The page numbers at the top of the pages are interred into the
    text (and that is the correct pagination for the book; the automatic
    pagination is wrong). 3- There is an appendix at the end of the book
    (“الزيادة على تاريخ داريا”) which is added to the manuscript.
