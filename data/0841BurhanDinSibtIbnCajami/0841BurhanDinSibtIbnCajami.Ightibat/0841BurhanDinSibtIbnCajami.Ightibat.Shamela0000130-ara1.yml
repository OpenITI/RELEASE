90#VERS#COMMENT##: Good correspondence. Pagination failed. There are
    abbreviations (e.g., qaf, sin, etc.) that precede the name of the
    biographical entry, which refer to major collections of hadith (see p.
    21 of intro in printed edition). These are thus editorial additions to
    the text. They have not been marked at this stage, although perhaps they
    might need to be removed at a later stage.
