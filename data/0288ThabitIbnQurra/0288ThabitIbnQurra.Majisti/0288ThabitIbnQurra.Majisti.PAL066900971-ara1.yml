90#VERS#COMMENT##: Transcription of the Tunis ms. (Dār al-kutub al-
    waṭaniyya 7116) of an Arabic translation of the Almagest by Isḥāq b.
    Ḥunayn, revised by Thābit b. Qurra.  Transcription by Pouyan Rezvani
    (https://ptolemaeus.badw.de/team/46).  Text digitized by the Ptolemaeus
    Arabus et Latinus project at the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften.
    Citation: ‘Ptolemy, al-Majisṭī (tr. Isḥāq b. Ḥunayn/Thābit b. Qurra)’
    (update: 31.07.2020), Ptolemaeus Arabus et Latinus. Works,  URL =
    http://ptolemaeus.badw.de/work/201. The text was converted to OpenITI
    mARkdown by PV.  The text contains numerous tables and images
    (diagrams).  The tables are very complicated and have been converted
    into markdown (for cells spanning multiple columns, PV used the approach
    outlined here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/49212652). PV also created
    images for each table (`img/jadwalxx.jpg`). Standard markdown links have
    been used to link to the images. The transcription contains references
    to Toomer’s English translation and Heiberg’s Greek edition of the
    Almagest; PV has kept these in the mARkdown text for now as `/Txxx/` and
    `/Hxxx/`. Arabic characters representing a number  (or points on a line
    in geometrical explanations) are overlined in the manuscript and tagged
    as `<u class="num">` in the transliteration;  PV has tagged these
    characters with a `@NUM@` tag.
