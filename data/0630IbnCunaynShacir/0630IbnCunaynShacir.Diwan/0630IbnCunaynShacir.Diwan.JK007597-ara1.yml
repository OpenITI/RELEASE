90#VERS#COMMENT##: I have cleaned up the text and formatted all the poetry. I compared this version with the published version by Mardam Bek, but they are in fact not exactly the same. The digital edition only preserves the poems themselves, in the same order as the printed edition, but leaves out all the contextual information and the subtitles of the work. By contrast the digital edition provides the meter for every poem, which is not given by the edition. The material left out is in fact very valuable information for correctly interpreting the poems, so a new edition is needed.
