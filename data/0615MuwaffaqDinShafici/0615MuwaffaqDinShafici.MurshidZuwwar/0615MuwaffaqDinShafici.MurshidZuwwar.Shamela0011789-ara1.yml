90#VERS#COMMENT##: The second volume which appears after the indexes is kind of research notes of the editor. So, I tagged it as editorial. 2- Sometimes there are a few asterisks under a title and after that the author starts talking about a different subject. To present the most accurate categorization of the subjects, these parts need additional titles in square brackets; however, someone must read the whole text very carefully to be able to add such titles.
