90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH, GVDB
90#VERS#COMMENT##: HRH: In most places, dots are either removed or
    replaced by another punctuation mark (“ or ,). There are few mistakes in
    Editpad Pro version: some numbers in the text are wrong (V01P353, N.
    732; V01P416, N 900; V02P094, N 1194; V02P307, N. 1554; V03P036, N.
    1745) and some others are removed (V02P307, N 1555; V03P235, N 2033).
    After page 134 in Vol 5, there is a redundant word at the beginning of
    some pages, which is either the repetition of the first word of the page
    or something completely irrelevant (e.g. P. 134, 142, 147, 150, 162.
    163, 164, 167, 168, 170, 173). Moreover, in this Volume, Pages 227-239
    are repeated at the end of the pages (I didn’t tag this redundant part,
    since it must be deleted). 2- PageV05P119 onwards is an appendix added
    by the editor in which he has collected the missing parts of the first
    section of the book. I showed the beginning of this part by a blank
    first-level header. GVDB: deleted redundant part noted. Untagged all
    headings of the appendix and changed HRH's empty header into an
    editorial one. Corrected the wrong numbers noted. Deleted footnote
    markers.
