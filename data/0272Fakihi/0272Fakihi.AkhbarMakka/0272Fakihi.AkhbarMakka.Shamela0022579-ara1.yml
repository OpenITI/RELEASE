90#VERS#COMMENT##: In most places, dots are either removed or replaced
    by another punctuation mark (“ or ,). There are few mistakes in Editpad
    Pro version: some numbers in the text are wrong (V01P353, N. 732;
    V01P416, N 900; V02P094, N 1194; V02P307, N. 1554; V03P036, N. 1745) and
    some others are removed (V02P307, N 1555; V03P235, N 2033). After page
    134 in Vol 5, there is a redundant word at the beginning of some pages,
    which is either the repetition of the first word of the page or
    something completely irrelevant (e.g. P. 134, 142, 147, 150, 162. 163,
    164, 167, 168, 170, 173). Moreover, in this Volume, Pages 227-239 are
    repeated at the end of the pages (I didn’t tag this redundant part,
    since it must be deleted).
