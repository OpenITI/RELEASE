90#BOOK#COMMENT##: A list of questions about the trustworthiness of
    ḥadīth transmitters (al-jarḥ wa-al-taʿdīl). The questions are presented
    as being asked by al-Barqānī to his teacher al-Dāraquṭnī.  There are
    currently two editions in the corpus:
    * ed. ʿAbd al-Raḥīm Aḥmad al-Qashqarī, Lahore 1404 (JK000506):
    based on a majmuʿ manuscript in the Aḥmad III library in Istanbul (no.
    624/21, 16 pages); the manuscript is complete, but the editor edited
    only the first two parts of the text, not the third.
    * ed. Magdī Fatḥī al-Sayyid Ibrāhīm, Cairo (Maktabat al-Qur'ān):
    1409/1989 (Shamela0001060, Shia002080):  based on a manuscript in the
    Dār al-Kutub in Cairo (majmuʿ no. 1558/ḥadīth, folios 539-546), and a
    20th-C copy of the text in that manuscript (Cairo, Dār al-Kutub no.
    25580/B);  these copies contain many ijāzāt and samāʿāt.  This edition
    contains only the third part of the book. A more recent edition combines
    the three parts but has not been digitized yet (ed. Abu ʿUmar Muḥammad
    b. ʿAlī al-Azharī,  Su'ālāt Abī Bakr al-Barqānī lil-imām Abī al-Ḥasan
    al-Dāraquṭnī  fī al-jarḥ wa-al-taʿdīl wa-ʿilal al-ḥadīth, Cairo (al-
    Fārūq al-Ḥadītha): 1427/2006) (for more on the different editions: see
    the introduction to al-Azharī's edition, pp. 27f.)
