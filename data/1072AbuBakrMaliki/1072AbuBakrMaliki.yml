90#AUTH#COMMENT##: Abū Bakr al-Mālikī was born in Qayrawān and was one of those who continued to live
 in Qayrawān after its destruction (449/1057). There are several death dates given by classical and modern scholars.
 Based on information about his students and information from the Kitab al-Riyāḍ
 he must have been alive during the Norman conquest of Sicily (between 464/1072 and 484/1091).
	See Bakkūsh’s introduction to Riyāḍ al-Nufūs, pp. 20-22. Therefore, earlier dates of death given by biographers is likely a confusion.
	 We take 464 AH as his earliest death date.
