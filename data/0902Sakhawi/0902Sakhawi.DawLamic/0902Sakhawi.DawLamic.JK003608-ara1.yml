90#VERS#COMMENT##: The edition is the same as the one published by Dar
    al-Jalil, Beirut (n.d). The text has been annotated previously by at
    least 2 other people. I have checked merely by selecting random passages
    to compare between the digital and printed editions. Not all
    biographical entries are numbered so it is hard w/o going through the
    entire text to be sure if it is all there. However, there were a number
    of entries missing from v 8 pp. 33 until the end of the volume (page 300
    odd), and this section has been thoroughly re-tagged, which was somewhat
    labour intensive given that many were biographical entries were missing:
    193, 216, 239-41, 255-6, 265-6, 276, 302-6, 379-81, 394-5, 459-70,
    490-2, 499, 56-59, 630, 643, 666-7, 671, 700, 713-18, 731, 765, 774,
    806, 849-53. As per other annotator's comments copied below there were
    erroneous names and spellings. Otherwise, the entries I checked appeared
    in order (nb: roughly every 100th entry). I have removed some outdated
    tags. There are some cross references tags (### $$$), and I have left
    these in for now - perhaps the reviewer can decide if they should be
    kept. The following was detailed in a readme file in the text's folder,
    which perhaps means the digitised texts need to be revisited due to the
    quality of the transcription. [I have added the comments below to the
    formalised part of the yml]:"## 1. Describe why you chose this specific
    version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse? Because I
    continued the .inProgress data of some other person. ##2. Which edition
    you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination
    the same? http://archive.org/download/waq10879waq/. It is identical, but
    flawed in some parts. ##3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many?
    (Guesstimate is fine) Continously throughout the text.  ##4. Add any
    comments on the text: Some names are not complete and have apparently
    only partly been transferred into the .ara file. Volume 7 Entry No. 79
    is missing. Some parts of names are missing all over the text. Volume 7
    Entry No. 509 is missing, except it's last line/ ##5. Volume 2 between
    page 67 and 69 was a clusterfuck of doubled entries and missing
    pagination. I corrected that. {## Comments by : [Christoph Guemmer]."
