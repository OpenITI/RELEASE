## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

Because I continued the .inProgress data of some other person.

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

It is identical, but flawed in some parts.

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

Continously throughout the text. 

## 4. Add any comments on the text

Some names are not complete and have apparently only partly been transferred into the .ara file. 
Volume 7 Entry No. 79 is missing. Some parts of names are missing all over the text
Volume 7 Entry No. 509 is missing, except it's last line/

## 5. Volume 2 between page 67 and 69 was a clusterfuck of doubled entries and
missing pagination. I corrected that.
