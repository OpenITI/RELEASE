90#VERS#COMMENT##: The link in VERS#LINKS that I have used for collation
    (and is exactly the same as the SHAMELA edition) leads you to a payment-
    based website and you must have an account to see the contents. Another
    edition of the book that is accessible online can be found here
    (however, the titles are different in this edition):
    https://archive.org/details/ntdrntdrntdr. 2- The typist has not typed
    the number of Quranic verses in the first chapter of the first volume.
