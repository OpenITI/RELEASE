## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

## 2. Add any comments on the text

Headlines are taged following the table of contents
There are few hundred proper names in the text which are not marked at all yet -> seems very time consuming to find them all. I started to tag them but they are very hard to find. I didn't know if it's worth the effort. If needed I can work on it later.
