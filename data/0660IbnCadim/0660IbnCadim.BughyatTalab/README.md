If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

I chose Shamela as there has all the 12 Volumes wheras JK is missing two. Also the structure seems better as there are alreadz a lot of tags there. 

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

paginiation is the same -> all volumes in one file


## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

No typos found.

## 4. Add any comments on the text

Quality of the text was good. Basically everything was marked, so I just had to change the tags to give it a structure.

Volumes 2 -10 are biographies, 11 & 12 are tabels
