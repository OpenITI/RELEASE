90#VERS#COMMENT##: The URI is wrong. This is a commentary upon
    commentary, namely a tacliqa by Imam Ruhollah Khomeini on another hadith
    commentary by Qadi Sacid Qummi (d. 1107). The text of the original and
    the commentary is given together, in hashiya style on one page.  For
    stylistic and other analysis the text should be broken down and split
    into original and commentary. In order to make it easier, I have marked
    the beginning of the quotations as level three subheadings.
	The headers on the pages (such as توضيح الخبر) are also inserted into the text. They should be deleted.
