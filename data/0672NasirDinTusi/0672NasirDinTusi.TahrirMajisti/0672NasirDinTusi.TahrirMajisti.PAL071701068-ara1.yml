90#VERS#COMMENT##: Transcription of the Istanbul ms. (Nurosmaniye 2941)
    of Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī's commentary on the Almagest.  Transcription by
    Paul Hullmeine (https://ptolemaeus.badw.de/team/38). Text digitized by
    the Ptolemaeus Arabus et Latinus project at the Bayerische Akademie der
    Wissenschaften. The text was converted to OpenITI mARkdown by PV. The
    text contains images (diagrams). Standard markdown links have been used
    to link to the images. Arabic characters representing a number  (or
    points on a line in geometrical explanations) are overlined in the
    manuscript and tagged as `<u class="num">` in the transliteration;  PV
    has tagged these characters with a `@NUM@` tag. NB: the text contains
    tables, which have not (yet) been transcribed by Paul Hullmeine!
