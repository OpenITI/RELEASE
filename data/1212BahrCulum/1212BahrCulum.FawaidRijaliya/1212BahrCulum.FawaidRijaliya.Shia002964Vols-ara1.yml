90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: In volume 2, from page 50 to 95, all the biographical tags that have asterisks (### $ *) are a subsection (actually the teachers) of the previous biographical tag. I showed them by an asterisk so that they are distinguishable from the other names that are sorted alphabetically. Besides, this part needs some headers. I showed the place of the needed headers with “#:section:”. The headers must be added by a specialist in front of my blank tags (using the table of contents at the end of the book) to make the categorization of this part more accurate. 2- In volume 3, I see a few pages in which the footnotes are interred into the text without any footnote marker (see Page 271 and 280 for example).
