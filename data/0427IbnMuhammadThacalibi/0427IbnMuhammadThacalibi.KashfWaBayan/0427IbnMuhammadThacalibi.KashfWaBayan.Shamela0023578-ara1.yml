90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: All the Quranic verses are omitted in Vol 4 (and I
    put a second-level header tag to mark their beginning, in conformity
    with other volumes). In Vol 8, pages 37-41 and the first paragraph in
    page 301 are omitted. The first paragraph in vol. 7 page 188 is also
    omitted. Some very minor inaccuracies in the text like “فأنزلنا” instead
    of “فأنزل” in Vol. 1 P. 202 Line 14 and “ويربي” instead of “ویزکی” in
    Vol. 2 P. 383 Line 20.
