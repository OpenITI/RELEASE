90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The JK version was better for annotating, yet I
    didnâ€™t pick it out for annotating because in most pages, a great amount
    of the footnotes were interred into the text and this made the text
    unusable. 2- There were very small discrepancies between the text and
    the PDF: number 423 (page 605), number 443 (page 627) and number 636
    (page 839) are omitted in the text.
