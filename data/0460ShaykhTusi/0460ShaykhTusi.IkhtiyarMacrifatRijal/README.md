1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?



2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

The PDF wasn't the exact match: In the text were parts missing or added. But all biographies exists in the same order.

3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

Once the name of a biography was "مقلاص أبوالخطاب" (p. 246) in the PDF and "مقلاص بن الخطاب" (line 13730) in the text
4. Add any comments on the text
