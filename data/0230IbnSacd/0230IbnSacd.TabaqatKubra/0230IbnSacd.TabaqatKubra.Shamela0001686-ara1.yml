90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text appears to be quite clean; occasionally some
    extra elements that must have been added for structural clarity of the
    book; the text is structured quite well, but still takes time to sort
    things out; structure of the book - juzʾ > (group/settlement) > ṭabaqaŧ
    > tribe/clan; includes about 4,700 biographical records (another edition
    numbers ~5,500); some pages were missing --- identified with length
    outliers test and restored; some passages might still be missing.
