Please, copy-paste questions from `text_questionnaire.md` into this file and answer the questions.
If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

I chose the Shamela version because it was much better pretagged than the JK version.

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

I used the following PDFs:
https://ia800201.us.archive.org/30/items/FP158184/00_158184.pdf
https://ia800201.us.archive.org/30/items/FP158184/01_158184.pdf
https://ia800201.us.archive.org/30/items/FP158184/02_158185.pdf
It is the same edition as the Shamela text, pagination is the same.

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

I noticed following typos:
- some names are written incorrect (not more than 3)
- in two cases, the numbering of the biographies in the Shamela text is wrong (1.: biography no. 358 instead of 359 and 2.: biography no. 772 instead of 672)
- there were some parts in the text where the headline of a level II chapter and the name of the first biography in this chapter were mentioned twice. For example biographies no. 451, 456, 492, 513 etc. (approximately 10 cases)

There are some mistakes in pagination:
- wrong pagebreak in the Shamela text (concerns biographies no. 148 and 149)
- in one case I noticed that the page numbers are incorrect in the Shamela text (concerns biography no 705)
- page 408 is missing completely in Shamela text
