90#VERS#COMMENT##: Comment inserted in metadata was removed. two editor
    sections were added at the beginning and at the end (the latter includes
    fihris). the headers were left untouched. the first level header (with
    one pipe) includes the volumes' numbers. the biographies are all tagged
    as men's biographies with one dollar sign, but there are many women's
    biographies that can be easily spotted by looking for female names or
    bint XYZ. some headers are misstagged or untagged when compared to the
    edition. editorial and shamela additions inserted in the text.
    manuscript folio margin notes inserted in the text. this text's
    structure would require deeper reflection to assess whether a thrid
    level header would be meaningful to provide the text with a better
    structure.
