90#VERS#COMMENT##: In the lower part of PageV01P068-70 there is a kind of supplement that is added by the editor; but the typist has wrongly typed it as the continuation of the text. I tagged this section as editorial. However, the original text must be extracted and the rest must be deleted. 2- I see quite a lot of redundant Salli-Allah in the text before and after some titles.
