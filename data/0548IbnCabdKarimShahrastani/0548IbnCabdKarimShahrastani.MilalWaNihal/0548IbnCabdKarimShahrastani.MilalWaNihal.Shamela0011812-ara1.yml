90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Peter Verkinderen
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The annotated version is the edition by ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz
    Wakīl. This edition was selected because the JK and Shia files  (other
    edition: by Muhammad Kīlānī) does not contain any punctuation. The
    quality of the digitization is generally very good.  The conversion
    script obviously had problems tagging some titles, but PV cleaned these
    errors.  The table on pp. 50-51 was missing; PV added it.
