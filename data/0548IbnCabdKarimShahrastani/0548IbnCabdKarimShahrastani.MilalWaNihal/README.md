## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

I annotated the Shamela version, based on a generally better quality of digitization, not based on the quality of the edition (about which no information was available). The JK and Shia versions both lack any punctuation.

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

I used the scan of the edition digitized by Shamela (see YML files for links). The text is very close to the edition, pagination is identical.

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

Very few typos.

## 4. Add any comments on the text
