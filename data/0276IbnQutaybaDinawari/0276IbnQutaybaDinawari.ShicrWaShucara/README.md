## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

the other didn't have any pretagging and no clear structure to work with
## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

page numbering not exactly but close
## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

in the text there were things tagged, the pdf didn't contain, but it seemed to me to make sens for a structure. I tagged these spots as second level chapters so you can decide how to deal with them.
## 4. Add any comments on the text
