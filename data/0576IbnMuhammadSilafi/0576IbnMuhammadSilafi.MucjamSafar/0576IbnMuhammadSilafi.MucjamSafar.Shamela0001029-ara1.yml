90#VERS#COMMENT##: Some of the numbers in the text include information about poets; however, it is not possible to tag the names of these poets structurally. They need to be tagged inside the text. I showed the beginning of each number by an asterisk (i.e. # *) so that they can easily be found. 2- There is an appendix at the end of the book, but there is no information at its beginning to show what kind of appendix it is and why the editor has separated this part, while the numbers are continuing.
