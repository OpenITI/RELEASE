90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: SP Loynes
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Very close to the printed edition with no obvious
    errors. There are a number of images in the printed edition, which are
    obviously excluded in the text version. From page 190 of volume IV of
    the PDF printed edition only the odd numbers are scanned; so this part
    of the text could only be partially checked, but given the closeness of
    the rest of the text, and that it was possible to check 50% of the
    pages, it is unlikely to be divergent.
