90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Cornelia Neubauer; Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text was tagged by Cornelia, vetted by Gowaart.
    Annotation was largely fine, I have deleted the editorial section and
    have refomatted the last section's titles to only highlight the
    numbering as there are no actual headers here. I have formatted the
    poetry in the text. Cornelia noted one pagination issue, but in fact
    there were many more, with currently 870 search matches for V00P000 in
    the text, i.e. the majority of the pages have not been noted. It appears
    that the page boundaries are nevertheless correct (barring the one noted
    by Cornelia: "In one case the pagination of the shamela text did not
    correspond to the PDF: between pageV02P406 and page V02P407"), so this
    should be possible to fix with a script. I corrected two such pages
    before I realised there are too many of them, so I left this as is. For
    now, the text is still easily navigable because of the numbered
    biographies.
