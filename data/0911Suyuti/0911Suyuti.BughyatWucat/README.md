## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

I chose PDF https://archive.org/download/FP12042/01_12042.pdf and https://archive.org/download/FP12042/02_12043.pdf from the PDF folder
