90#VERS#COMMENT##: A really awkward text for tagging. I inserted most of
    the endless tags manually and kept up tagging until eighth-level
    headers. There are a few titles in each page of the 13 volumes that are
    sometimes not even bold, and the end of the titles is not very clear in
    many cases. It is possible to tag the text more detailedly; however,
    that would be line-by-line tagging because in many pages, there is a
    title in every two or three lines. Moreover, a lot of titles must be
    added to make the structure clear. For example, a title like “الفصل
    الأول” might refer to the preceding paragraph which introduces a new
    subject but it has no title to show what subject is being discussed and
    what these fasls are about. So, a more accurate tagging is possible, but
    someone must read the whole text carefully and tag several items in each
    page, and add a lot of titles to make the structure clear. 2- The 13th
    volume consists of three sections. But, as the editor mentions at the
    beginning of the volume, these three sections are actually three
    different Kitabs, not three sections of one Kitab. 3- PageV04P044 is
    missing. 4- These pages include images: PageV13P181, PageV13P184,
    PageV13P187, PageV13P221.
