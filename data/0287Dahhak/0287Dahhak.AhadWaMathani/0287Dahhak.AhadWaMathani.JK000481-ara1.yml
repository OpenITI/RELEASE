90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- “ومما أسند”, which is a subtitle, is missing in
    most places (and I placed a blank header in its place). 2- A part of
    some of the names is missing. This happens just when two titles appear
    successively without any space (see for example PageV02P314 name NO. 260
    which is “المزني” instead of “نعمان المزني” and is appeared after a
    first-level title). 3- About categorizing the titles: 3.1) The book does
    not have any table of contents and most of the headers are names of
    tribes; so, understanding the correct categorization of these tribes are
    very difficult. I tried to find the relations between the persons by
    searching their names in other sources and present a correct
    categorization as long as it was possible. For example, in the first
    volume, the complete name of “مطعم بن عدي” (in PageV01P359) is “مطعم بن
    عدی بن نوفل بن عبد مناف” and therefore his category is a subcategory of
    “ومن بني نوفل بن عبد مناف”, but the next category “بني أمية بن عبد شمس
    بن عبد مناف” is not a subcategory of this category (i.e. “مطعم بن عدی بن
    نوفل بن عبد مناف”) since “عبد شمس” and “نوفل” are brothers and there
    isn’t a major category which encompasses both these categories; so, they
    should be tagged just as parallel categories, and this is true about
    many other categories. For example, from PageV01P411 to PageV02P123, all
    categories are the family of “لؤي بن غالب بن فهر”; nevertheless, none of
    them is a subcategory of the other, but they are all parallel
    categories, without any parent category. The same is true about
    PageV02P164 to PageV02P282 in which all categories are members of the
    family of “عبد مناف بن كنانة” and also about PageV02P283 to PageV02P439
    in which all categories are members of the family of “إلياس بن مضر”,
    again without any parent category. 3.2) It seems that from PageV04P256
    under the title “ومن ذكر اليمن ورجالهم” to PageV05P337, all the tribes
    are from Yemen. If so, they all should be tagged as subcategories of
    this category. I searched about all the tribes, but I couldn’t make sure
    whether all of them were settled in this place or not (this needs the
    confirmation of an expert).
