90#VERS#COMMENT##: In the metadata the publisher 'Dar al-Qalam
    al-'Arabi' is wrongly detailed as located in Beirut. It is in Aleppo
    according to Worldcat and elsewhere online. However, I could not find
    this edition online. It has been collated with an edition which includes
    largely the same titles, but not pagination. For the majority of the
    work the text is the same. Occasionally titles vary. There are 2 missing
    sections: one of about half a page, and another of 2 1/2 pages of the
    printed edition. The first is from line 1504; missing part approx. pg.
    53-4 of the pdf. The second is from line 2216; missing part approx. pg.
    83-5 of PDF.
