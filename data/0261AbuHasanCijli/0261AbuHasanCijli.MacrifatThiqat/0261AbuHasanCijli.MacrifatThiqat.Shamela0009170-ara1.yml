90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- Some pages include a section entitled: “تضمينات
    الحافظ ابن حجر”. Both in the PDF and in Editpro text, this part is
    separated by dotted lines (and I didn’t change it). 2- A few lines are
    copied redundantly in PageV02P427. 3- A missing title in PageV02P517.
    4-I created a “CHANGE URI” issue for this file, since the name is wrong
    and it is in a wrong folder.
