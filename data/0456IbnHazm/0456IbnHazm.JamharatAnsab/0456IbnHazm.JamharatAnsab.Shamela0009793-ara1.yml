90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The digital version is a reprint of the PDF I used for collation. 2- In some parts, I tried to present a correct categorization of the titles according to the relations between tribes and persons. However, it is very difficult to do so because understanding these relations needs reading the text very carefully by a specialist in the science of Ansab, and besides, even after reading the text carefully, one will find out that it is not really possible to categorize these titles accurately. So, the other solution is to leave categorization as it is and consider all the tribes and persons as first-level categories (that kind of scrupulous categorizing is probably not needed at all). This might need the confirmation of a specialist.
