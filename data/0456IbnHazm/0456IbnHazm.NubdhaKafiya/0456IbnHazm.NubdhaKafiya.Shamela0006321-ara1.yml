90#VERS#COMMENT##: The pagination does not follow at all. The text quality is acceptable, but pagination does not follow the edition.
	There are a few minor diversions from the pdf at hand (such as paranthesis are missing from the subheadings (Fasl), which
	makes me suspect that perhaps the digital text is based on a pirated version.
