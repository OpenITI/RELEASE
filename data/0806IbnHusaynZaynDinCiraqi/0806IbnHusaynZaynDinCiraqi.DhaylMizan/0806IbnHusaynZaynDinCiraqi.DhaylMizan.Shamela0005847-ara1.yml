90#VERS#COMMENT##: This supplement to Mizan al-A'tadal by al-Dhahabi
    (itself a reworking of Imam Ibn 'Adi al-Jurjani's al-Kamil fi Dhu'afa'
    al-Rijal) is included as the 3rd volume in this 3 volume set. It appears
    that the digital edition has been drawn from this edition as the
    pagination matches, although the numbering of pages was not completed
    (all read PageV00P000). Parts of sections under Harf al-Tha' and Harf
    al-Jim are duplicated. Harf al-Dhal is also repeated later on between
    Harf al-Mim and Harf al-Nun. Otherwise, good correspondence.
