90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This text was digitised with Google OCR and corrected
    by Gowaart. I have followed the edition's lack of consistently noting
    the hamza and using a generic ha instead of ta marbuta. The edition of
    the text is somewhat complicated. It interlaces the poem included here
    with a 19th century anonymous mukhtasar (see Salibi, "Maronite
    Historians of Medieval Lebanon", p. 39) as well as a commentary by the
    editor. For OpenITI purposes I felt it was best to separate these three
    layers, and assign separate URIs to the poem and the mukhtasar, while
    deleting the editorial commentary. I have also deleted the titles, as
    these seem to be part of the commentary rather than the poem. As a
    result the pagination looks like the text has gaps, but this is entirely
    due to my reorganisation of the texts.  The poem is a zajaliyya in
    Lebanese colloquial. This poetic form is in quatrains, as opposed to the
    usual Arabic two hemistiches. Currently mARkdown does not accommodate
    this form (in which the first three hemistiches rhyme with one another,
    while the last hemistich follows the endrhyme of each other quatrain in the
    poem), so I have followed some other editors of other texts by splitting
    the quatrain into two parts. This way it looks identical to other Arabic
    poetry, except that the end rhyme only happens every two lines.
