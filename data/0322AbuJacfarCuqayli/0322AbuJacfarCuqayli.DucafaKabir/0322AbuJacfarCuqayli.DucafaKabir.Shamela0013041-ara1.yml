90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- Although the PDF and the Editpro versions are
    exactly the same, sometimes there are a few redundant words or parts
    which show that the Editpro version must be a little different from the
    PDF version. For example, “أصله سرخسي” is added to name 514 in page
    PageV02P070 or “الجزري” is added to name 519 in PageV02P074. Besides,
    there are some redundant explanations for some names, like numbers
    1086-1098 in PageV03P114 ff (these redundant explanations are similar to
    the contents of their respective footnotes) or numbers 1654- 1665
    (PageV04P101 ff). There are also some extra numbers which do not exist
    in the PDF > NO 733 + 1 (PageV02P204), NO 807 + 1 (PageV02P253), and NO
    1574 + 2 (PageV04P021). 2- Numbers 186-188 in PageV01P150 appear in a
    different place (after number 193). Number 109 in PageV01P095 is
    missing.
