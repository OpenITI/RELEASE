90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text has been digitised via Google OCR and checked by
    Gowaart. The text is problematic and the edition is not great.
    Authorship is doubtful, but unresolved, as contents continue past death
    date of author. The text has only been preserved partially and in a
    manuscript containing another text (a tabulated listing of all caliphs
    up to the time of writing), possibly composed by the same author. The
    edition contains both texts under the same title, but according to Franz
    Rosenthal these are two different texts (A History of Muslim
    Historiography p. 146 n. 1), and the Tibr al-Masbuk title only refers to
    the second part. I would concur with this and have as such only
    digitised the second part. The first part is also challenging to
    digitise because of its tabular format.
