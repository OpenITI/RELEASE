90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Poetry tagged. The pdf is another print (unknown which one) of the same edition used for the digital text (the seventh Bulaq printing). The worldcat link is also not for this seventh edition, but an earlier one. As a result, the pagination is different or simply missing in most places where there is simply PageV00P000 (almost 4000 instances) . Because of this and because of the difficult to follow layout of the pdf, I have annotated based on textual logic. Structure was pre-tagged but needed significant cleaning up. I have done this but may have missed some parts due to the huge size of the work. Fortunately the organisation is very clear in general: first level for books, second level for bab, third level for individual numbered hadith with a rare fourth level for tanbih and similar glosses. This division is fine across the majority of the work except in book 66 which introduces another layer of Quran verses, which I have designated as second level, same as bab chapters. This chapter probably needs revision. There seem to be some redundant parts with repeated sections, see for example book 70, the beginning of bab 12 is included twice. In book 42 the title of bab 1 is also repeated. There are more such instances.
