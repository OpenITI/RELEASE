90#VERS#COMMENT##: This is a typed up collation of two manuscripts
    containing this treatise. The one linked is the main manuscript from al-
    Azhar (49091/Majamic 1003), the other, later manuscript is held by the
    Chester Beatty Library (Ar 4664). An edition of the text exists
    (https://archive.org/details/FP146987 not yet in the corpus) but
    diverges somewhat from my edition, which makes it worthwhile to
    eventually include both as separate instances in the corpus.
