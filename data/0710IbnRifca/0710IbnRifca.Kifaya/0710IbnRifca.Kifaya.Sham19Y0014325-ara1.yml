90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text was pretagged by Peter's conversion, which has worked perfectly due to the text's very systematic structure. I did not have to correct any of the headers. Pagination also appears to be fine. I changed the , commas to ØŒ which looks better. Sometimes the text seems to skip pages, but this is because of extensive footnotes taking up all the space in the edition. In a few cases these empty pages were replaced by strings of "000", which I have deleted. I have tagged the relatively few verses of poetry in the text, though I may have missed some as this was not consistently formatted in the text, so I had to do various searches for phrases typically introducing poetry or mentions of the meter. 
 The edition contains an extra volume (volume 20) with a hashiya by IbnRifca's student al-Isnawi. This has not been digitised, but may be worthwhile to digitise as a separate text.
