90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The editorial section at the end of the book is
    the note of the scribe. 2- It would be better if the annotation is
    reviewed by a specialist in Arabic literature. The structure of the text
    is not easy to understand (for example, I’m not sure whether the lines
    that appear in parenthesis (and in Bold) right after the (second-level)
    titles should be considered part of the titles or not. Seems that
    sometimes they should and sometimes it is not necessary. However, I’m
    not sure about this).
