90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: SP Loynes
90#VERS#COMMENT##: It was necessary to manually add tags for the
    semantic units in the first and last chapters. These sections were
    therefore checked carefully. Small sections of text are missing, quite
    often, esp. at page divisions (e.g. 29,35). Parts are missing from pg.
    52, vol 2. p.69. On a number of occasions parts were duplicated. Some
    spelling mistakes. The odd title is omitted (e.g. pg. 201). Pagination
    is not always consistent. There are figures in vol 2 pgs. 134, 9, 41, 4.
    Random parts of the rest of the text were checked, and they appeared in
    order. Given the amount of discrepancies located in the sections just
    described, one wonders if this might also be the case for the rest of
    the work. A closer text critical analysis of the whole might be in order
    to confirm the quality of the text.
