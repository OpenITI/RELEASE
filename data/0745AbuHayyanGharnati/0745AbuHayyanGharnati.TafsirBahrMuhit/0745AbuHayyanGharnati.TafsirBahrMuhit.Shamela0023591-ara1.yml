90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: SP Loynes
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The digital edition references an edition from 1420.
    This does not exist on Worldcat, but one does appear published in 1412
    (1992). I have collated to a later edition published in 2010. This
    appears only as published in 2005 on Worldcat. Pagination is the same.
    These are the only editions from Dar al-Fikr that appear on Worldcat,
    and they have been linked to in lieu of the other editions (although I
    suspect the first is an error in the metadata). The qur'anic quotations
    are no longer distinguished from the commentarial text in the digital
    edition. Pages occasionally out by a line or two, usually when qurâ€™anic
    quotations carry over from one page to the next. The quotation of Q
    17:78-82 is located in the wrong commentarial section and should be on
    pg. v.7 83-84.
