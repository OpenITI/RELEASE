90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text did not have automatic tags and all the tags are added manually. 2- I used the ### $ as a simplified tag for dictionary items. Most of these dictionary items are names/adjectives attributed to the places (or tribes) with ‘y’ nisba (like “الجليلي” which is somebody or something from “الجليل”, a mountain in Yemen), but there are also some other types of words (like “السوفسطائي” = sophist, or “الموسيقي” = music, or lesser-known laqabs of people). I think we can’t tag these items separately and all these simplified tags must ultimately be replaced by the complete tag for lexical entries (i.e. ### $DIC_LEX$). Even the first example above cannot be considered a toponym (because it is “الجليلي”, not “الجليل”). 2- In some cases, after explaining about the place or word, the author names people who are from that place or whose names are attributed to that word. Such names are not part of the structure and need to be tagged inside the text.
