90#VERS#COMMENT##: Publisher is wrongly detailed as Dar al-Basha'ir al-
    Islamiyya in the metadata. The actual publisher is Maktab al-Matbu'at
    al-Islamiyya. The text is extremely long, amounting to over 10 volumes.
    As such, textual correspondence has only been checked on a number of
    select pages throughout the work. The numbering of biographical entries
    appears consistent w/ the printed edition. Pagination failed; there are
    also some other embedded pages numbers in square brackets (generally odd
    only), but these are also not consistent w/ the printed edition, and
    should probably be removed.
