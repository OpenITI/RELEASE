90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: SP Loynes
90#VERS#COMMENT##: PARTIALLY TAGGED ONLY. I had to manually add all of the biographical
    entries, and I have also numbered them consistently w/ the printed edition
    (this also helped ensure none were missed when tagging). Pages
    occasionally out by a couple of lines. Texts varies occasionally from
    printed edition w/ words omitted or added by scribe and/or small scribal
    errors (e.g., fi rajab vs. fi shahr rajab, hassan vs. al-husayn). Volume
    numbers are in wrong places (now marked as editorial). Occasionally the
    order of the biographical entries is not entirely consistent w/ the
    printed edition: in the case of additional entries, I have tagged but
    not included any numbering. The odd bio entry is missing; increasingly from v2 onwards: For example, no. 40, 45
    p271; part of bio 5 missing on p292; missing bio 36, p300; 14
    is missing from p324. 22 is missing from v2:p28, textual variance on 27, 28 missing; v2:p29, 36 missing. These are marked with the new ### |MISSING| tag. Raised a Text Quality issue.
