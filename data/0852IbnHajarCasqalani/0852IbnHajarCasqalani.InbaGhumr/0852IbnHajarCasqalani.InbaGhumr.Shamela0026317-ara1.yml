90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: SP Loynes
90#VERS#COMMENT##: I had to manually add all of the biographical
    entries, and I have also numbered them consistent w/ the printed edition
    (this also helped ensure none were missed when tagging). Pages
    occasionally out by a couple of lines. Texts varies occasionnaly from
    printed edition w/ words ommited or added by scribe and/or small scribal
    errors (e.g., fi rajab vs. fi shahr rajab, hassan vs. al-husayn). Volume
    numbers are in wrong places (now marked as editorial). Occasionally the
    order of the biographical entries is not entirely consistent w/ the
    printed edition: in the case of additional entries, I have tagged but
    not included any numbering. The odd entry is missing (e.g., no. 40, 45
    pg, 271). Part of bio 5 missing on pg. 292, missing bio 36, pg 300. 14
    is missing from pg. 324.
