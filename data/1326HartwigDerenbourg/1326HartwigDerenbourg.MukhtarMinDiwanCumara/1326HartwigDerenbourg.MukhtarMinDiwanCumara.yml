90#BOOK#COMMENT##: Selection of ʿUmāra's dīwān, made by Derenbourg; 
    in the introduction to his edition (p. ix), he writes that he left out 
    passages in which no personal or geographical names are found,
    but included also some passages he liked for aesthetic reasons. 
    The selection is based on two separate compilations of ʿUmara's poetry
    (see introduction p. x-xi): an anonymous compilation in which the poems 
    are sorted alphabetically by their rhymes (extant in a copy dated 984/1576); 
    and a separate, unordered, compilation made in 644/1215 
    by Nabih al-Dīn Abū al-Ṭāhir Ismāʿīl b. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. Aḥmad al-Anṣārī,
    who also made an "edition" of ʿUmāra's Nukat.
    Derenbourg followed the former compilations, and added the few additional
    passages found only in the other compilation under the heading 
    "Dhayl Dīwān ʿUmāra" (see introduction pp. xi-xii).
