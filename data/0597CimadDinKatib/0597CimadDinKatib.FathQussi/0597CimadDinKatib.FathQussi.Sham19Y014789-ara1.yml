90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text scraped from Shamela by Peter with automatic
    conversion of headers. Checked by Gowaart. The edition on which the
    digital text is based seems to be a modern reprint of the 1888 Carlo de
    Landberg edition (close comparison would however be necessary to
    establish the relationship more certainly) which remains the standard
    edition for researchers.
