90#VERS#COMMENT##: This version is better than the Shamela one which has
    a lot of problems as far as its relationship to the edition goes (typist
    didn't type parts he considered redundant or repetitive) but had a
    cleaner digital text. I did not have access to the 1964 edition on which
    this is based, only on the 1994 reprint on which the Shamela version is
    (loosely) based -- however, I haven't been able to find a pdf of it
    online (I downloaded this version years ago). As it should essentially
    be the same text I have edited according to the newer edition. There are
    some typos in the text, and a number of pipes I didn't successfully
    delete with Regex. Digital text also still has the corresponding
    manuscript pages, but I would argue to keep those in for easy reference.
