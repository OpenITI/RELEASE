90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Paragraph markers are not consistent in the text. I
    have corrected a few in the introduction, but it would take too much
    time to apply it throughout the text. Some mistagging in the
    introduction's table of contents which I have also reformatted. I've
    rendered every (sub)header onto one line. Poetry has been automatically
    tagged, except incomplete bayts which only have the first hemistich,
    these are generally buried in paragraphs. I have only corrected them
    where I could spot them easily. The Arabic text seems to be of quite
    high quality but does have typos (for example second word on line 5366
    should be su'ila not mathala).
