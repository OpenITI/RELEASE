90#VERS#COMMENT##: The original edition on which this digital text  is
    based (al-Maktaba al-Maymaniyya (?), n.d.) was not found;  the edition
    used for collation (Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyya, 1997) contains a text that
    consists of 5 layers (see vol. 1, introduction, pp. 3ff.): 1.

    and (4) are tagged in the original text file; the original edition
    perhaps contained only those three texts. The text was split into its
    constituent parts using a script.
