90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This text was scraped in four parts from Hindawi by
    Peter Verkinderen, the headers from that website were automatically
    converted to mARkdown. Gowaart then cleaned up the mARkdown and combined
    the four files into one file in the correct order. The digital text
    itself is based on the 1928 Cairo edition by Zirikli and is of high
    quality, except for the pagination which is not noted on the webpage and
    thus not present in this file.
