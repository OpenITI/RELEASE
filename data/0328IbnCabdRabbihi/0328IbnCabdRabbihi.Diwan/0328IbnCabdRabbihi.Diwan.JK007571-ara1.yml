90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The Editpro edition cannot be found because there
    is no data in the METADATA section to show which edition it is. I found
    several editions of the book and compared them with the text until I
    finally found this PDF that I have used for collation. Although it is a
    different edition, the poems are exactly the same. The only difference
    is that the few words in the PDF preceding each poem to explain about
    its content are missing in the Editpro text. Moreover, there are two
    long poems at the end of the PDF. One of them is missing in the text and
    the other one has some extra lines. 2- The blank titles that I have
    added signify the beginning of alphabetical order for the rhyme-words.
