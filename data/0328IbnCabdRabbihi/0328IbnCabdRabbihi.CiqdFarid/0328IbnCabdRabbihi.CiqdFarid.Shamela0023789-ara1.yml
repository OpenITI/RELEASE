90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- I just tagged the titles that are bold (exactly
    following the structure of the text). Nevertheless, in each page, all
    the parts that are quotations can be tagged as headers. Although this
    would be against the structure of the text (because the text has just
    made some of the titles bold, not all of them), if the text is supposed
    to be divided as detailedly as possible, it could be done. 2- The
    descriptive table of contents at the end of the book is not reliable for
    arranging the titles. A lot of titles are missing in this table and
    besides, its categorization is not correct. 3- In PageV03P291-314,
    titles are categorized according to the relationships between tribes. I
    tried to understand these relationships by searching in other sources
    and present a correct categorization of the titles. 4- These titles must
    be added to the text (in front of the blank tags that I have added): in
    PageV05P140-211 the names of the caliphs (e.g. “معاوية بن يزيد بن
    معاوية” in page PageV05P140, …); in PageV05P244: “غَزَوَات”.
