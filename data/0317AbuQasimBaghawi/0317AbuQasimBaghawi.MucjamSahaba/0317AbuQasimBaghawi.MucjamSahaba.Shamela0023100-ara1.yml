90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- First –level headers = volumes (5 volumes);
    second-level headers = book sections (25 sections); third-level headers
    = alphabet letters; fourth-level headers = specific names under each
    alphabet letter. The “book sections” are actually useless as they
    signify nothing in the text. They can be omitted; however I kept them
    since they are part of the text division anyway. 2- The typist has
    intentionally left out the “سماعات” parts (for example, PageV05P336- 443
    or PageV05P436-440).
