90#VERS#COMMENT##: The PDF I used for collation is a different edition. In a few cases, I see sentences that are more or less than what appears in the digital version. 2. The text did not have automatic tags. All the tags are added manually. 3. The tag ### $ is used for all kinds of entries including names of people, places, tribes â€¦
