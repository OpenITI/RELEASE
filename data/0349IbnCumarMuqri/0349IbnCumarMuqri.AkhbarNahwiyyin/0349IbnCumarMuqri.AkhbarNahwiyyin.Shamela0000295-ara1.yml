90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The Editpro text is different from the PDF in
    pages 39-42 (in both Shamela and JK versions). However, most probably
    this is a problem in the PDF, not the text, since the numbers in the PDF
    jumps from 13 to 54. 2- A missing title in page 18. 3- The editorial
    section at the end of the book is the note of the scribe.
