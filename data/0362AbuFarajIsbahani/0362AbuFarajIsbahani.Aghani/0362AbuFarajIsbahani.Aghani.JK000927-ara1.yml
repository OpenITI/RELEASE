90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- I used a different edition for collation. However,
    it is very similar to the text and I didn’t see major changes. The only
    difference between different editions of this book is the titles; and
    that’s because most of the titles in all editions are added by the
    editors in arbitrary places, but the text is the same. I must mention
    that the titles that have been added by the editor in Editpro edition
    are occasional. They do not cover all the contents and do not show the
    change of subjects (the PDF I have used for collation is much better in
    this respect and another edition in the following link has even more
    accurate titles:
    https://www.noorlib.ir/View/fa/Book/BookView/Image/3440). 2- There are
    some extra first-level headers in the PDF that are added by the editor
    and do not appear in Editpro edition. Since they are very useful for the
    structure of the text, I added them as blank first-level headers
    (However, I didn’t add the titles because I’m not allowed to add
    anything to the text. I just showed their positions with first-level
    blank headers. The structure of the text will become more accurate by
    adding them to the text). 3- The text includes a lot of “صوت” sections.
    It is difficult to determine whether these sections are independent
    sections or they are subsections of the previous sections. One must read
    the text very closely to understand this and this needs a review by a
    specialist in Arabic literature. 4- Missing/Redundant parts: Volume 10
    is missing and volume 21 has appeared (redundantly) in its place. In Vol
    1 of the PDF, Pages 23-26 (i.e. “مقدمة مؤلف”) are missing. One page
    (PageV07P349) is redundant at the end of Vol 7. A paragraph in
    PageV21P253 and a paragraph in PageV21P257 are repeated. PageV08P392-433
    is an appendix and does not exist in the edition I used for collation. A
    paragraph in PageV06P128 (page 88 of the PDF), a paragraph in
    PageV11P172 (page 117 of the PDF), a paragraph in PageV12P225 (page 137
    of the PDF) are shifted to the previous pages. 5- Two other edition of
    the text that can be found on the internet are accessible here: https://
    ebook.univeyes.com/8827/pdf-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%BA%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%

    in the same folder is an appendix to the text entitled “ملحق الأغاني
    (أخبار أبي نواس)”. Explanations can be found in its yml file.
