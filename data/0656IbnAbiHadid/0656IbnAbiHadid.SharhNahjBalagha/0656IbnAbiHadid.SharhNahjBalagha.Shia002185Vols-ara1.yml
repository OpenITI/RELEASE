90#VERS#COMMENT##: Couldn't find a suitable pdf version, so worked with
    the printed edition in AKU-ISMC library. This edition is also the one
    noted in  EI3 article on Ibn Abi l-Hadid by Tahera Qutbuddin. Pagination
    is correct and paragraphs usually are as well.   There are footnote
    markers in the text, and html-hyperlinks to Quranic citations.  From the
    end of the second volume onwards the typist didn't write all section
    markers for asl and sharh and did not mark some such headers between
    square brackets, so I have tended to correct these to improve logical
    text structure. Poetry has not been formatted consistently.  In volume
    three some of the headers in square brackets differ from those used in
    the pdf-edition, although they refer to the same subjects. At the start
    of each volume the typist has copied some editorial data. In cases where
    this information takes up more than a line or two, I have used the
    editor tag to distinguish this, and followed it when necessary by an
    empty header tag to denote where the text picks up again. Numbering of
    sections is inconsistent both in being actually numbered and in whether
    Arabic or Latin numerals are used -- I have harmonised these.
