90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The digital text consists of a first section edited
    from a manuscript (ends on line 6483 with the original manuscript's
    colophon) and then a second section with related materials. The division
    is also very clear in the edition, with the title for this section
    appearing on a separate title page, followed by a blank page. What
    follows is thus a separate book (consisting of related hadith) that was
    added to the first text. It is somewhat unclear whether this should be
    considered as an editorial appendix or as part of the main text, as it
    is apparently also taken from the same source manuscripts. I solved this
    by making the header for this second section a first-level header and
    adding another first-level header with the book title at the top of the
    text, and making everything else second-level.  A second more
    complicated issue with the text is its authorship: the text is  in fact
    attributed to Wahd ibn Munabbih in a recension (riwƒÅya) of Ibn Hisham.
    In other  similar cases for Ibn Hanbal for example, these texts have
    been filed under Ibn Hanbal.  Do we want to do the same for this text?
