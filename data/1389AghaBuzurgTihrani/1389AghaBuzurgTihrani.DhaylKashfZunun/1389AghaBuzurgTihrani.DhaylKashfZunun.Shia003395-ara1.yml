90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This text is not an independent text and cannot be used by itself. It is a supplement to AghaBuzurgTihrani’s “كشف الظنون عن أسامي الكتب والفنون”. It has actually collected the missing lines that must be added to the original text. The general format of the book is like this: “Page … Line …: These missing lines must be added: …”. The only way to use this text is to combine these missing lines to the original text and put them in their appropriate places (this is actually what the publisher should have done in a newer edition). I just showed the editorial section. The main text has nothing that needs to be tagged and ideally it should be combined in the original text by the specialist who will read the text closely.
