90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The Editpro edition was not found. The PDF I used
    for collation is a different version; however the only difference I
    found was a redundant title in page 66 in Editpro text. 2- There are a
    lot of names in the text that need to be tagged. Sarah and Maxim told me
    not to tag them since they are inside the sentences and cannot be
    considered as part of the structure of the text. The list of these names
    can easily be found at the end of the PDF.
