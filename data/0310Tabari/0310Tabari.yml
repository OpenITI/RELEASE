90#AUTH#COMMENT##: metropolis of northern Persia, Rayy, he received an intellectual
  formation which gave him solid grounding for his future career. The most significant
  of his teachers there was ʿAbd Allāh b. Ḥumayd al-Rāzī (d. 248/862), who as Ibn
  Ḥumayd figures as an oft-quoted authority in al-Ṭabaī’s History. => no URIs for
  this teacher! study with the leading scholars of Wāsiṭ, Baṣra and Kūfa, whom he
  was afterwards to cite in his own works, such as Muḥammad b. ʿAbd al-Aʿlā al-Ṣanʿānī
  (d. 255/869) and Muḥammad b. Bas̲h̲s̲h̲ār, called Bundār (d. 252/866, see Sezgin,
  i, 113-24) in Baṣra, and Abū Kurayb Muḥammad b. al-ʿAlāʾ (d. 247 or 248/861-2) in
  Kūfa. => no URIs for these teachers!
