90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The book consists of four Musnads written by Tabari.
    Except for the last volume, the tables of contents are descriptive (i.e.
    a description of the contents of the paragraphs); so, it is not possible
    to follow them for tagging. The annotator has no choice but to follow
    the titles that appear in the text, although these titles are not only
    occasional and don’t cover the whole subjects, but also vague (like “ذكر
    ذلك” which is a title to signify the beginning of a new section
    explaining about the preceding paragraph), and therefore don’t help the
    reader understand the structure of the book. I added a few extra blank
    titles just where the subject matter considerably changes and there is
    no title to signify this. Moreover, The order of the subject matters are
    sometimes vague (for example, sometimes the author returns to the main
    subject after a long part about a different subject). All in all, the
    text is complicated in structure and if it is very carefully read, it
    may be possible to tag it more accurately and more detailedly. 2. The
    vertical lines (|) in some texts represent the end of lines in the PDF.
    I didn’t omit these lines.
