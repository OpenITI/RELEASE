90#BOOK#COMMENT##: Work on ḥadīth, never finished by the author. 
    The conception of the work was "to provide an exhaustive and penetrating 
    analysis of the philological and legal implications
    of each ḥadīth mentioned and to discuss its meaning
    as well as its significance for religious practice and theory.
    (Rosenthal 1989, History of al-Ṭabarī I: General Introduction, p. 128).
    The work is organized according to the 10 main ṣaḥāba that transmitted ḥadīth,
    and then into smaller parts according to isnāds that go back to these 10.
    For example, in the part about ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿAbbās, 
    discussions of (aḥādīth that go back to) 7 transmitters who transmitted 
    Ibn ʿAbbās' aḥādīth on the authority of ʿIkrima are extant.
    Four extant fragments have been edited:
