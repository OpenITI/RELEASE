90#VERS#COMMENT##: This file is a composite file,  composed of 4
    separate  JK files:
    * JK008250: vol. 1, ed. Maḥmud Shākir  (Musnad ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿAbbās)
    * JK008251: vol. 2, ed. Maḥmud Shākir (Musnad ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb)
    * JK000920: vol. 4, ed. Maḥmud Shākir (Musnad ʿAlī b. Abī Ṭālib)
    * JK008269: (vol. 5), ed. ʿAlī Riḍā  (Musnads of ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b.
    ʿAwf,  Ṭalḥa b. ʿUbayd Allāh and al-Zubayr b. al-ʿAwāmm) NB: Shākir only
    published volumes 1, 2 and 4,  there is no volume 3 edition. The
    structure of the book is quite complicated  below the second-level
    headings,  and the current lower-level headings should not be considered
    final.  HRH added a few extra blank titles where the subject matter
    considerably changes and there is no title to signify this.  The
    original text files contained pipes (|) that represent the end of lines
    in the printed edition; HRH kept these pipes,  but they were removed by
    PV during the vetting process. The aḥādīth mentioned in the edition and
    the digital files; the Shākir edition distinguises between the main
    aḥādīth that form the subject of the discussion  (in the paper edition,
    with bold numbers;  in the digital files: numbers followed by a hypen)
    and other aḥādīth (simple numbers, without hyphen).  The Riḍā edition
    does not use this system,  and numbers the aḥādīth consecutively.
