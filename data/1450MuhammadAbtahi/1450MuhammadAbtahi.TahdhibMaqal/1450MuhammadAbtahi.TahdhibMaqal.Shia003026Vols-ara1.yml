90#VERS#COMMENT##: This book is a commentary written by the contemporary
    author, Abtahi, on Najashi’s Kitab al-Rijal. The point is that the whole
    commentary is in the footnotes. So, the body text is Kitab al-Rijal by
    Najashi and Abtahi’s commentary is in the footnotes. We should not
    delete the footnotes in this text, since the footnote is actually the
    main text here. 2- I tagged all the names in the body text, i.e.
    Najashi’s text, manually. It is not possible to tag the text in the
    footnotes at the time being since it is in a bad condition and to tag
    it, first it needs to be separated. 2- Numbers 198-9 are lost in both
    the PDF and the digital version. It must be a problem in the printed
    version.
