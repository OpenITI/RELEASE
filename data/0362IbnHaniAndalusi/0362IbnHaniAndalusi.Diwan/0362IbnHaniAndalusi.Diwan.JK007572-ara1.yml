90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The only thing that needs to be tagged in this
    Divan is the alphabetical letters that show the alphabetical order of
    the last letter of the rhyme-words (i.e. “حرف رويّ”), and I tagged them
    as first-level blank headers. 2- Numbers of the verses of poems appear
    at the end of previous line. They must be shifted to the beginning of
    the next lines. 3- Another edition of the text which is accessible on
    the internet can be found here:
