## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

pdf found for this version

## 2. Add any comments on the text

- structure of the text is exactly the one of the pdf
- I think there are proper names included in the text, but they are neither marked in the pdf nor in the text I worked on. I think so, because I found another PDF (which I added to urls_additonal) were proper names were highlighted through numbers
