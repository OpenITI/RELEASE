90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- There are four names at the beginning of each
    chapter that do not include any information, but I have tagged them as
    ### $. This is because the information regarding these persons and their
    poems appears in the following pages. The author first names four poets
    at the beginning of each chapter and then presents some information
    about them in the rest of the chapter (sometimes in a disordered style
    and in combination with other information about poetry in general and
    …). I used this pattern for all chapters. Moreover, I have tagged the
    names of the poets in the beginning of each chapter (i.e. NOT inside the
    chapter at the beginning of their respective poems). There are two
    reasons for this: firstly, the names appear in complete form just in the
    beginning of each chapter. Inside the chapter they appear just in short
    form (i.e. without any Kunya and Nasab). Secondly, some of the names
    don’t have any explanation at all in the text and are just mentioned to
    complete the categorization. 2- Numbers 523-532 are lost in the text.
    But this is the problem of the book not Editpro version (As it is
    explained on page 522 of the PDF). 3- The book consists of two parts,
    but it seems to me that it is one volume (the page numbers are
    continuous both in the PDF and Editpro version). So, maybe it’s better
    to change the pagination.
