90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The Editpro edition cannot be found because there
    is no data in the METADATA section to show which edition it is. The
    edition I have used here for collation is very similar to the text and I
    didnâ€™t see major changes. There are just some extra titles in the text
    (that are helpful) and some other titles are a little different.
    Besides, sometimes the PDF has a few extra titles (I showed them with
    blank headers). 2- The text was plain without any automatic tags.
    3-Missing parts: PAGEV01P35-45 of the PDF; PAGEV04P118-120 of the PDF
    (=PageV02P126 of the text); Third paragraph in PAGEV01P47. 4- Two other
    editions of the text can be found here: https://m.marefa.org/images/9/91
