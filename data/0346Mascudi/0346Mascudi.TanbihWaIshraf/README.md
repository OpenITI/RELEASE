Please, copy-paste questions from `text_questionnaire.md` into this file and answer the questions.
If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

Both Shamela and Shia are of the same edition, but Shamela has already (most of?) the headings tagged.

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

Same.

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

Type your response here.

## 4. Add any comments on the text

42: The edition has taqdima

148: 7 pages missing.

149: the edition has an additional basmala

149 / 150-1: the basmala and title are switched in the edition

I am tagging the headers as they appear in the edition. Most headers, however, have a subheading that gives more explanation. I do not tag these as they appear as normal text in the edition.

7483: page 348 has a colophon

Mascudi is erroneously filed under 346; it should be in the 300AH folder, not 400AH

## 5. ...
