90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- These pages are omitted in the Editpro version:
    418, 419, 422, 423, 426, 427,430, 431. I had a quick glance at the text
    and I found some little inaccuracies: in page 160, verse number 7 and in
    page 334, the first three verses are omitted in Editpro version.
    Moreover, from page 429 onwards, the puny lines that show the page
    numbers and the line numbers of the original book are omitted. 2- At the
    end of the book, there are three sections that have been added by the
    editor. I didnâ€™t use the Editorial Tag for these parts as, in my view,
    they must be considered parts of the original text; nevertheless, this
    depends on the aim of the researcher who is supposed to use the text.
