90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- These pages are missing in the digital version:
    418, 419, 422, 423, 426, 427,430, 431. I had a quick glance at the text
    and I found some little inaccuracies: in page 160, verse number 7 and in
    page 334, the first three verses are missing in Editpro version.
    Moreover, from page 429 onwards, the puny lines that show the page
    numbers and the line numbers of the original book are missing. 2- At the
    end of the book, there are three appendixes that have been added by the
    editor. The first "زيادات في المختصر، المختار من طبقات الشعراء"
    (PageV01P429) is a selections of the poems in Tabaqat; the second
    "اختلاف الطبقات والمختصر" (PageV01P462) includes the differences between
    these two texts; and the third "نصوص ليست في الطبقات ولا المختصر"
    (PageV01P463) includes the parts that do not appear in those two texts.
    I tagged these appendixes as editorial  parts, since they are not part
    of the original text. However, the beginning of each part is marked by
    three asterisk (#***) so that they can be found easily. This needs the
    opinion of a specialist.
