90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The main publisher seems to be “دار الجيل” (see
    the PDF). 2- Missing/Redundant parts: A part of PageV02P032-3 is
    redundant. PageV02P089, PageV02P167 and PageV02P298 are typed twice.
    PageV02P274 and PageV02P281 are missing. PageV02P283 is missing and a
    redundant part appears in its place. 2- The editorial section at the end
    of the book is the note of the scribe. 3- Another edition of the text
    that is accessible on the internet can be found here:
